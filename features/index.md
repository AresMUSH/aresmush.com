AresMUSH is designed with three key goals:

## Make it Easier to Play

Ares makes it easier to play for new and veteran MUSHers alike.

* A fully-integrated [website/wiki](/web-portal).
* A familiar experience for Penn and TinyMUX players.
* Player handles, which bring a taste of social media to MUSHes.
* A ground-up focus on making a pleasant user experience.

## Make it Easier to Create a Game

Existing MUSH clients effectively require you to have a coder on board before you can make a game.  Coding should be an afterthought, not your primary concern. Ares makes it easy to create a game.

* Turnkey installation with automated scripts and step-by-step instructions.
* A complete MUSH-in-a-box that can be installed and configured by people with no prior code experience.
* A fully-integrated [Web Portal](/web-portal), so you don't need to manage a separate wiki.
* Easy web-based configuration.
* FS3 comes built-in, and can be swapped for several other [skill system](/features/skills.html) plugins.

## Make it Easier to Code

Coding is hard in any language, especially if you've never done it before.  However, Ares code offers some advantages over traditional MUSH softcode:

* Mainstream languages - Ruby (for the server) and Ember JavaScript (for the web portal) with robust community support.
* A robust plugin system that makes it easy to change core functionality.
* Extensive tutorials to teach you Ares coding from the ground up.

## But Wait...

As cool as Ares is, it's not the right choice for every game. Before choosing Ares, be sure to check out [Choosing the Right MU Server]({{site.baseurl}}/features/server-roundup.html).
