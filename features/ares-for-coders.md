Coding is hard in any language, especially if you've never done it before.  However, Ares code offers some advantages over traditional MUSH softcode.

## Mainstream Languages

All Ares code uses mainstream languages: Ruby and Ember Javascript.  Both are easier to read and understand than traditional MUSH softcode. There are a lot more Ruby/Javascript programmers than softcode programmers, as well as an extensive community for support.

## Tutorials

Ares offers a robust suite of [tutorials](/tutorials/code) to help you learn Ares code from the ground up. We also have a [Discord](/feedback.html) for code and game questions where you can get help.

## Plugins

Every major system, from channels to combat, is implemented as a [Plugin](/features/ares-for-admins.html).  The real power of plugins is that you can add, modify or replace any plugin. 

For example: A war MUSH might swap out the movement plugin for one that restricts movement based on action points during combat. A fantasy MUSH might swap out the description system with one that limits character descriptions based on what clothing items they had purchased. 

These changes replace the standard plugins, so you don’t end up with a hardcoded “who” and a softcoded “+who” on top of it.
