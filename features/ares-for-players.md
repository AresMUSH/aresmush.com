AresMUSH is designed for players familiar with PennMUSH and TinyMUX.  Virtually all of the commands you're familiar with will work just as you expect.  

The [Ares for Vets](/tutorials/play/ares-for-vets.html) tutorial gives a run-down on some of the differences between AresMUSH and Penn/Tiny.

## Web Portal

AresMUSH features a fully-integrated [Web Portal](/web-portal) that allows you to interact with the game from a web browser.  Far from just a telnet window embedded in the browser, the Web Portal offers a rich experience and can fully replace (and enhance!) traditional game wikis.

## Commands

Commands in Ares are designed to be simpler and more approachable to new players, while at the same time preserving shortcuts for experienced players used to commands working a certain way.  Where possible, it supports both Tiny and Penn syntax for things like mail and channels.

## FS3 Third Edition

Ares features a [new edition](/fs3/fs3-3) of the FS3 skills and combat system, which streamlines skills, adds new combat options, and offers various other improvements over prior editions.

## Handles

[Player Handles](/handles) bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games. Through your handle, people can identify you as a player, not just as a character.

## Little Things

Ares tries to make playersâ€™ lives easier.  These little conveniences add up to a more pleasurable experience overall, and include:

* A better AFK system.
* More helpful help files.
* A clear separation between IC and OOC command output.
* Utilities that people often code themselves,  from multi-descers to dice rollers.
* Flexible keepalive handling.
* Custom command shortcuts.
* And much more!
