AresMUSH comes with the [FS3 Skills and Combat System](/fs3/fs3-3) built in, providing a complete character creation and conflict resolution system.  FS3 is a unique skills system designed specifically for MUSHes.  However, FS3 is entirely optional.  You can turn it off with a mouse click in the configuration settings.

Other plugins for several off-the-shelf skills systems can easily be installed, including:

* Fate
* Cortex
* FFG Genesys / Star Wars
* Simple Traits (as found on many comic games)
