AresMUSH comes with the [FS3 Skills and Combat System](/fs3/fs3-3) built in, providing a complete character creation and conflict resolution system.  FS3 is a unique skills system designed specifically for MUSHes.  However, FS3 is entirely optional.  You can turn it off with a mouse click in the configuration settings.

Other plugins for several off-the-shelf skills systems can easily be installed, including:

* [Fate](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-fate-plugin)
* [Cortex](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-cortex-plugin)
* [FFG](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-ffg-plugin) (Based on FFG's Genesys RPG, with decent--but not perfect--support for the FFG Star Wars RPGs)
* [Simple Traits](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-traits-plugin) (as found on many comic games)
* [GeneriC RPG](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-rpg-plugin) (generic TT RPG support with manual sheets, manual rolls)
* [D6 Adventure](https://github.com/cailleach1310/ares-d6system-plugin) (based on WEG's open D6 adventure system)
