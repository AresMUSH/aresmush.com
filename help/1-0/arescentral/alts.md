# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your [1mplayer handle[0m (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.  See [Handles](/help/1-0/arescentral/handles) for more information.

Handles are completely optional!  Because of this, your game may have other ways for you to declare if you have multiple characters (a request or wiki page, for instance.)  Consult your local game policies for details.
