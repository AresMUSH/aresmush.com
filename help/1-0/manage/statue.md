# Turning Trolls to Statues

Sometimes a troll's goal in life is to be sitebanned, and you can frustrate them by turning them into a statue instead.  Characters who have been turned to a statue cannot execute any game commands - not even to quit.

`statue <name>=<reason>`

If for some reason you change your mind, you can un-statue them.

`unstatue <name>=<reason>`
