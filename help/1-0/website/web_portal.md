# Web Portal

The game's Web Portal provides an interface to the game that you can access from any browser. Using the Web Portal, you can play the game from a browser, browse characters and scenes, manage your character's profile, check mail and bulletin board posts, view the online help and more.

> Note: Chrome is the only browser officially supported, and the web portal is optimized for viewing in Chrome.  It will probably work in other browsers, but the quality of the experience may vary.

Type `website` to get the address to the Web Portal.
