teaser: What's one more feature?

The Ares beta is chugging merrily along. Several people have chosen the [Easy Mode install option](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/install), which is the low-hassle way to get an Ares game of your very own. There are a half-dozen games in various stages of development, and their feedback has been invaluable in shaking out issues and the need for additional configuration options. Having a more rigorous release cycle has also driven improvements to the upgrade process.

Although I declared ‘dev complete’ back in April, I couldn’t resist tacking on a few features from the ‘wish list’ while the beta was going on. The temptation to keep adding ‘just one more thing’ is strong. Some of the highlights:

* Advantages in FS3, which let you represent things that cost chargen points but aren’t skills: Resources, ranks, spells, etc.
* A ruby command to let you execute code snippets from the MUSH client (inspired by Evennia’s @py command).
* More IC Time options, including time ratios and custom day/month names.
* Player tags in room descriptions to identify MUSH beginners (if they opt in to the system) and admins.

I’ve also built out the [Ares Extras](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/plugins), which contains plugins that are not part of the main install, including:

* A skills system based on the Cortex RPG.
* A simple Traits system, such as the kind you might need on a statless or comic game.
* Roleplay Preferences, inspired by Cobaltasaurus’ system for Penn/Tiny.

My hope is that other coders will contribute plugins of their own to the Extras repository, so in time it can become a valuable community resource.

I’d like to get a bit more feedback on the [coding tutorials](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/code/) and see some people actually successfully creating custom code before I’m comfortable leaving beta. But for now, at least, things are going smoothly.
