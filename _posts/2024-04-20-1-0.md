AresMUSH 1.0.0 is now released.

[Release Notes](https://github.com/AresMUSH/aresmush/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

It feels like there should be more fanfare for 1.0, but honestly not much has changed. There’s nothing epic in this release, just the usual batch of features and fixes. There will still be regular updates. The overall stability hasn’t changed appreciably from what it was a week ago, or a month ago.

So why 1.0 and not 0.110?

Well mostly - it’s a philosophical milestone. There are no major foundational shifts on the horizon. The code is solid, with over 100 games and nearly 1000 player handles built on it. Plus we have a snazzy logo now.

If not now, when?

So enjoy 1.0.0 (the extra digit just makes it easier to track patches), and thanks to everyone who’s contributed over the years, especially those who have built games on Ares so that people will actually use it :)
