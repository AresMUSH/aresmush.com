teaser: Public beta is live!
---

Ares reached an important milestone last month when the first public beta game went live: my own **Battlestar Galactica: Unification**. There have been a few minor issues, naturally, but fortunately nothing major exploded. It’s a gratifying culmination of the last four years of effort. I’m grateful to everyone who’s given their suggestions and support along the way, particularly the friends who were the first to brave the new server.

Next up? Making it possible for people other than me to set up and run an Ares game. That means writing instructions, adding admin commands for common activities, and creating a web front-end to make it easy to configure and customize a game. Oh, and responding to any more beta testing feedback.

So there’s still a ways to go before it’s ready for public consumption, but we’re getting there!
