Finding a MUSH to play on is always a challenge.  AresMUSH hopes to make that easier.

Cross-game advertisements are always welcome on the Game Ads BBS of [AresCentral](http://www.aresmush.com/arescentral), the social hub for all things Ares-related.  Players will log on to AresCentral to manage their player information, so it's a good way to reach a lot of people.

AresCentral also maintains a list of all games running the Ares engine.  As part of your game setup, you configure your game's name, category, website and advertisement.  AresCentral automatically keeps track of whether the game is up or down and lets players browse by category.

Here's a sample of an Ares game directory entry (prototype)
