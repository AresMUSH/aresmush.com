teaser: With a solid plan for the game administration, the beta is going strong.
---

The configuration eureka moment I described in the [last blog post](/blog/breaking-through.html) was a huge breakthrough on the game administration front, and a sudden flurry of activity on BSG: Unification has shown that performance and stability are still solid when you have a couple dozen people logged in. (Whew!) The influx of players new to Ares has also brought a lot of good feedback, leading to new commands and bugfixes.

All in all, I’m feeling pretty good about the Ares beta. Now it’s time to start looking ahead to the first official release.

I’ve whittled the backlog of ‘wish list’ code items down to the ones that are essential, and I’ve also started working on the necessary tutorials. Things are moving along nicely. Full steam ahead!
