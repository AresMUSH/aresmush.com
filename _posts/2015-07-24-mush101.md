MUSHing has traditionally been a tough hobby to break into.  AresMUSH is designed to reduce that barrier to entry.  To help with that, I've created a multi-part new player tutorial that covers step-by-step everything a MUSH player needs to know to play.  

You can view it on the AresMUSH website:  <a href="/mush-101">MUSH 101 Tutorial</a>. 

Suggestions for future tutorials are welcome!
