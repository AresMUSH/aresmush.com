teaser: Can Ares replace a game wiki?
---

Back in July, I asked a question on the [AresMUSH Forums](https://forum.aresmush.com/t/can-ares-replace-parts-of-a-game-wiki/): “Can Ares replace parts of a game wiki?”

The answer, pretty clearly, was “no”. Ares could not replace **parts** of a game wiki. Quite understandably, people did not want to have to go between two different websites to view a game’s information.

I soon realized that if I wanted the web portal to be successful, it would have to replace the **entire** game wiki.

So now it can.

You can see it in action on the [Demo Web Portal](https://mush.aresmush.com).

The scenes, character gallery, actors list, census, etc. are all drawn straight from the game’s database. No more needing to update your character’s wiki page just because you had a birthday or got promoted. No more log cleaning or entering `[[logIcon Faraday]]` wiki junk to create a scene log. You can customize your web portal profile too, either from in-game or from the web portal editor.

The wiki operates like one would expect, allowing you to create and edit pages. So far it just has what I consider essential features. It can’t do everything that MediaWiki or Wikidot can do, but it can do a lot – dynamic page lists and [markdown extensions](http://mush.aresmush.com/help/markdown) that make it easy to adapt from Wikidot.

There’s still a lot of work to do, but I’m happy with the direction it’s all going.
