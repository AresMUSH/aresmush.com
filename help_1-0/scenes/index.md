# Scenes

The scenes system lets you spawn a room for a scene.  You can indicate whether the scene is public (meaning anyone is invited to join) or private.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

`scene/start <name>=<private/public>` - Starts a scene.
`scene/stop [<#>]` - Stops a scene and recycles the room.
`scenes` - Lists scenes.
`scene/join <#>` - Joins a scene.
