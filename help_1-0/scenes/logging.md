# Scene Logging

When the repose system (see [Repose](/help/pose/repose)) system is enabled in a room, public scenes are automatically logged to the game's web portal (see [Website](/help/website)).  The log remains even after the scene stops.  

> **Tip:** Private scenes do not automatically appear on the web portal, even if the repose system is turned on.  But if you finish a scene and decide you want to share it, you can - as long as repose was enabled.  Just mark the scene public (`scene/privacy public`) before you stop the scene and it will appear on the web portal.

## Combat and Skill Messages

The scene system will automatically log FS3 combat and skill roll messages when characters are in a scene.
