In this part of the MUSH 101 Tutorial, we'll talk about some things you need to set up before you actually play.

## Getting the App

To connect to a MUSH, you'll need a MUSH client - an app that lets you access MUSH games, just like a web browser lets you access a website.  

There are many MUSH clients around.  Popular MUSH clients include:

* [BeipMU](https://beipdev.github.io/BeipMU/) (Windows)
* [Atlantis](http://www.riverdark.net/atlantis/) (Mac) 
* [Cheese WebMU](http://www.cheesesoftware.com/MUCon/) (Any Browser)
* [Duck Client](http://duckclient.com/) (Any Chrome browser - including Chromebook)
* [Potato](http://www.potatomushclient.com/) (Windows/Linux - it's broken on Mac at the time of this writing)
* [MUSHClient](http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/mushclient.htm) (Windows)

## Finding a Game

When it comes to traditional video games, you can visit your local game store or website and browse the titles until you find one you like.  Not really so with MUSHes.  A lot of advertising is done through word of mouth.

Here are some places you can look for games:

* [AresCentral Game Directory](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/)
* [Evennia Game Index](http://www.evennia.com/)
* [Mustard MU Directory](https://mustard.mythicus.net/)
* [Mu Soapbox](https://musoapbox.net/category/5/adver-tis-ments) - A MUSH forum containing an advertisement section.
