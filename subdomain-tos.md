## Terms of Service

AresMUSH subdomains are provided by Faraday of Wordsmyth Creations ("the author") free of charge with the following conditions:

**THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS SERVICE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  YOU AGREE THAT THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DEFECTS IN OPERATION, HARM TO THE GAME OR SERVER, OR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DAMAGES OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE SUBDOMAIN.**

The author retains all rights over AresMUSH subdomains. You may not sell, transfer, or use the domain for any other purpose beyond hosting an AresMUSH game.

The author has sole discretion to grant the use of AresMUSH subdomains, and may revoke the use of a subdomain at any time for any reason. The most common reason for revocation is the failure to have a game hosted on the subdomain.

This agreement only covers the use of an AresMUSH subdomain.  You are responsible for the game server (including any hosting fees), and for complying with the game software's [License Agreement](/license.html).
