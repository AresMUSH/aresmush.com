Experience is the way a character grows and changes over time.   

* Characters gain Experience Points (XP), which 'unlock' the potential to raise abilities.
* Raising abilities costs different amounts of XP, depending on the type and current rating.
* There may be timers or other limits to prevent raising a whole flurry of things all at once.
 
The exact mechanism for gaining XP and the cost of ability raises will vary from game to game depending on the game's desired tone, theme and values.

An example using a realistic progression (as explained in [Tweaking FS3]](/fs3/fs3-3/tweaking-fs3)) would be:

You gain 2XP per week.

You can only raise one ability each week.

Raising abilities costs a different amount of XP depending on the type and level, as explained below.  

##  Action Skills

| Current Rating | Cost |
| ---- |
| 0 | 2 XP |
| 1 | 4 XP |
| 2 | 8 XP |
| 3 | 16 XP |

You cannot raise a skill above 4 through XP.  Why?  Because becoming awesome at something takes **years** and games just don't run that long.

## Attributes

| Current Rating | Cost |
| ---- |
| 1 | 8 XP |
| 2 | 16 XP |
| 3 | 32 XP |

You cannot raise an attribute above 4 through XP.  This is simply a game-balance issue.

##  Background Skills

| Current Rating | Cost |
| ---- |
| None | 2 XP |
| Interest | 8 XP |

You cannot raise a skill above 2 through XP for the same reasons as Action Skills.

##  Language Skills

| Current Rating | Cost |
| ---- |
| None | 4 XP |
| Beginner | 16 XP |

You cannot raise a skill above 2 through XP for the same reasons as Action Skills.
