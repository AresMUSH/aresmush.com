> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:**  In-game, use the `sheet` command to view all of your character's abilities, and the `app` command to review your sheet for problems.  The `app` command is the same one that staff will use when reviewing your character, so it's a good way to get a heads-up about what they might object to.


> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:**  Use the `abilities` command in-game to see a list of availabile abilities.  The system will automatically assign you some starting Abilities based on your character's faction/position.  These are generally skills that everyone should know, so be sure to have a good reason before lowering a skill below its starting rating.  Even these starting Abilities count towards your Power Level.

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:** The `roll` command accepts a variety of options.  For instance:  `roll Melee` or `roll Melee+Wits-1`.   You can even specify a number of dice (handy for NPCs) like `roll 4`. 

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:** You can make a default roll just by rolling the appropriate Attribute.  For example `roll Brawn` will make an Everyman roll linked to your Brawn attribute, effectively rolling Brawn+1.

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:** To make an Ability Roll with a modifier, use the command `roll <ability>+/-<modifier>`.

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:** The system will automatically use the Attribute linked to a Skill.  If you want to use a different one, you can specify it in the roll command.  `roll <skill>+<attribute>`
