To protect your security, linking a character to your handle is a three-step process so we know that you're you on both ends.  This prevents someone from linking characters to your handle without your permission.

1) On your local game, log in with the character you want to link and find your character ID.

    handle/id

2) On AresCentral, use the character ID from step 1 to generate a one-time use link code specific to that character.

    handle/linkcode <character id>
    
3) Back on the local game, use your one-time link code from step 2 to link the character to your handle.

    handle/link <handle name>=<link code>

Tada!  That character is now linked to your handle.   You can unlink characters on AresCentral.  See `help handles`.
