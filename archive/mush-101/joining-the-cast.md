In this part of the MUSH 101 tutorial, we will cover how to create a character of your own.  

## What Should I Play?

This is the classic question for any game.  What do you want to be?   Often this will be a topic on the website, listing suggested character concepts (or ones to avoid because they aren't allowed or are overdone).    On *No Return*, for instance, there's a section under "Game Help" titled "Wanted Character Concepts."

This is also a good question to ask while you're logged in with a guest character, to see if anyone has any suggestions.    Refer back to the [previous tutorial](/mush-101/connecting-and-commo) for help using the public chat channels.

You may also want to browse through some of the "Theme" pages on the game's website.  These describe the game's setting.   There will probably be a lot of them; don't feel like you have to read them all at once.  But sometimes you'll read something about the setting that will spark an idea for something cool you want to play.

## A Name of Your Own

So you've decided that Zombies are your thing and you'd like to join *No Return*.  The next thing you're going to need is a name.   MUSH character names are normally limited to one word.  It's traditional to use your character's first name, but sometimes people use a last name or a nickname.

It's important to be consistent with the game's setting.   You don't want to be Lancelot on a zombie game, unless there's a really good reason why your character has such a strange name. 

Also avoid picking names that are directly from books and movies.   Making a character named "Luke" on a Star Wars game would be poor form, as would making someone named "Skywalker" on a Western.

Once you've got your name in mind, make your character using these steps:

1. Quit the game by clicking 'disconnect' in your MUSH client.
2. Click 'reconnect' to connect again.  
3. Instead of connecting to an existing character this time, type `create <name> <password>` to make a new one.

Congratulations – you have your very first MUSH character!

## Chargen

There's just one more thing you need to do before you can play.  Most games, including *No Return*, require you to flesh out your character in a process called Character Generation (Chargen for short).   The exact steps in Chargen vary from game to game, but *No Return*'s process is pretty typical.  It consists of four steps:

* **Background** – It's like a mini biography for your character.  Who are they?  Where are they from?   Why are they here?
* **Stats and Skills** – What is your character skilled at?  What are their natural strengths and weaknesses?
* **Finishing Touches** – Just a few housekeeping things, like your character's full name and what they look like.
* **Application** – The character must be reviewed by the game's administrators  before the character is allowed to play.  This ensures that the character fits into the game's theme and doesn't violate any rules.

Follow the game's instructions to set up the necessary information on your character and submit them for review.  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask on the chat channels.  The game administrators (the people who run the game) should be able to help you - that's what they're there for!
