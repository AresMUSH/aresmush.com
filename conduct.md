Participation in AresMUSH community features requires adherence to the following code of Conduct. 

{% note %}
Note that this code applies to the central community features (discord/forum/AresC/etc.) shared across all AresMUSH games; individual games will obviously set their own rules (though they are welcome to adopt these).
{% endnote %}

An account may be suspended at any time at AresMUSH admin's sole discretion. Egregious behavior on individual games or outside venues may be considered when evaluating conduct, on a case-by-case basis.

## Be Kind

Remember that there are people on the other end of the screen and don't be a jerk. We're all here to have fun.

## Be Civil

That does not mean you have to be all rainbows and sunshine. If you donâ€™t like something? Great. Say so respectfully. If you disagree? Great. Explain your arguments rationally. Even better - offer solutions or constructive feedback. Always remember that there is a person on the other end of the keyboard hearing your words, and treat them as a decent human being would.

If you need more guidance on what constitutes civilized discussion, we suggest the [Universal Rules of Civilized Discourse](https://try.discourse.org/faq#civilized).

## Harassment

**Harassment and bigotry are not tolerated here.** 

This can include (but is not limited to) making bigoted comments, making persistent and unwanted advances, acting possessive toward another player's time or attention, pressuring someone for RP when they have told you no, or just generally being creepy.

If someone is making you uncomfortable, please report them. We promise that we do not look down on anyone for reporting harassment, and take all reports seriously. Even if we do not feel the behavior warrants immediate dismissal, we will take note of it (in case it becomes a pattern). At your request, we will also tell them leave you alone. Think of it like a virtual restraining order, and breaking it is a bannable offense.

## Reporting

AresMUSH games have a variety of [tools]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/manage/trolls.html) to help you report inappropriate behavior. The Ares forum has a built-in way to flag posts, and on the discord you can simply tag or PM an administrator to bring something to their attention. You can also [contact]({{site.baseurl}}/feedback.html) admin directly.

If you know of a friend who's having problems, please encourage them to come forward. It's hard to take action when you only get vague, uncorroborated, second-hand reports.

## Discipline

Disciplinary action will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typically players will be warned first, but extreme cases may result in immediate dismissal. Ultimately, you're playing in staff's virtual living room, and players may be asked to leave at any time for any reason.
