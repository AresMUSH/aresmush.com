Experience is the way a character grows and changes over time.  

Experience has been completely changed in Third Edition, making it easier to raise to skills in parallel.  So it will still take a long time to raise your Firearms from 6 to 7, but your character's development isn't completely frozen in the mean time.

## Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are gained periodically to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time.  You spend them to improve your abilities.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:**  XP should always be spent in a way that makes sense ICly, and should be supported by RP.  Your character shouldn't just wake up one day and be a basketweaving expert.

XP awards and costs vary from game to game.  For an example, see **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

## Ability Freeze

Abilities are frozen for some time immediately after you exit chargen, and any time you raise them.  You cannot raise them while they're frozen.

> 
> For example, Dorian comes out of chargen with Medicine 5.  On her game, rating 5 is frozen for 4 months.  It only takes her 1 month to save up enough XP to raise it, but she still has to wait the full 4 months until the ability is un-frozen.  During that time, she is free to learn other things.

Freeze times vary from game to game.  For an example, see **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.
