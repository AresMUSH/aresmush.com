In this part of the MUSH 101 tutorial, we will cover how to find a game and create a character.  

## A Place to Start

When it comes to traditional video games, you can visit your local game store or website and browse the titles until you find one you like.  Not so with MUSHes.  There is no authoritative list of games out there, and a lot of advertising is done through word of mouth.

So what's a new player to do?

Here are a number of MUSHes in different genres.  Hopefully one of them might appeal to you.  These are established games with sizeable player bases, and I have friends who recommend each of them.   

* [Game of Bones](http://gobmush.wikidot.com/) - Game of Thrones
* [Star Wars: Omens](http://www.sw-omens.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Star Wars
* [Serenity](http://wiki.serenitymush.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - Firefly
* [Witchcraft and Wizardry](http://wandw.wikidot.com/) - Harry Potter
* [No Return](http://noreturn.closetgamers.com/) - Post-Apocalyptic Zombies
* [Chicago](http://chicagomush.com/) - Roaring 20's Historical

If you don't see anything that grabs you in the list above, you have a couple of options:

* Try doing web searches for your favorite themes (like "Star Trek MUSH").  
* Visit one of the games above (or [AresCentral](/arescentral)) and see if there are any advertisements for other games.
* Check out the advertisements posted on [MU* Soapbox](http://musoapbox.net/).

## Learning More

Any game worth its salt will have a website to tell you everything you need to know about playing there.  The amount of information on a game's website can be overwhelming at first, but don't worry – you don't need to read it all at once.  You'll usually find a good introduction to the game on the home page, or on a "Getting Started" or "Overview" link.

Browse around a little.  Read a few of the game policies.  It's okay if you don't understand them all just yet, because they use [MUSH jargon](/mush-101/mu-glossary), but make sure there's nothing that jumps out as a deal-breaker.

See if there's a gallery of current characters.  Read a few of their pages to see if they seem interesting.  Are these characters you would want to collaborate with to tell a story?   

> Many MUSHes let players pick an actor or actress to represent their character as a fun way to let other players immediately have an image of what that character is like.  You can think of it as the game's "dream cast".

## Taking a Look

Assuming the game looks interesting, the next step is to log in and have a look around.  To do this, you'll need to find the game's address.  This should be prominently displayed on their web page.  Remember, it takes a form like 'mush.aresmush.com port 7206'.

Just as we did in the [previous tutorial](/mush-101/connecting-and-commo), we'll use a Guest character.   Logging in as a Guest is a good way to get a feel for the game's community.   Check out the "who" list.  Are there many people to play with?  Does anyone greet you when you log in?  Are they friendly?

Let's check out *No Return*, the Zombie game.  Here's a short video illustrating the process:

Based on this visit, we've seen that No Return is friendly to guests, has a sizeable player base, and those players appear to be out playing with each other.  Those are all signs of a healthy game.

> All games have good nights and bad nights.  You may wish to observe the trends over the span of a week, and engage people in conversation to get a better feel for the game.

## What Should I Play?

This is the classic question for any game.  What do you want to be?   Often this will be a topic on the website, listing suggested character concepts (or ones to avoid because they aren't allowed or are overdone).    On *No Return*, for instance, there's a section under "Game Help" titled "Wanted Character Concepts."

This is also a good question to ask while you're logged in with a guest character, to see if anyone has any suggestions.    Refer back to the [previous tutorial](/mush-101/connecting-and-commo) for help using the public chat channels.

You may also want to browse through some of the "Theme" pages on the game's website.  These describe the game's setting.   There will probably be a lot of them; don't feel like you have to read them all at once.  But sometimes you'll read something about the setting that will spark an idea for something cool you want to play.

## A Name of Your Own

So you've decided that Zombies are your thing and you'd like to join *No Return*.  The next thing you're going to need is a name.   MUSH character names are normally limited to one word.  It's traditional to use your character's first name, but sometimes people use a last name or a nickname.

It's important to be consistent with the game's setting.   You don't want to be Lancelot on a zombie game, unless there's a really good reason why your character has such a strange name. 

Also avoid picking names that are directly from books and movies.   Making a character named "Luke" on a Star Wars game would be poor form, as would making someone named "Skywalker" on a Western.

Once you've got your name in mind, make your character using these steps:

1. Quit the game by clicking 'disconnect' in your MUSH client.
2. Click 'reconnect' to connect again.  
3. Instead of connecting to an existing character this time, type `create <name> <password>` to make a new one.

Congratulations – you have your very first MUSH character!

## Chargen

There's just one more thing you need to do before you can play.  Most games, including *No Return*, require you to flesh out your character in a process called Character Generation (Chargen for short).   The exact steps in Chargen vary from game to game, but *No Return*'s process is pretty typical.  It consists of four steps:

* **Background** – It's like a mini biography for your character.  Who are they?  Where are they from?   Why are they here?
* **Stats and Skills** – What is your character skilled at?  What are their natural strengths and weaknesses?
* **Finishing Touches** – Just a few housekeeping things, like your character's full name and what they look like.
* **Application** – The character must be reviewed by the game's administrators  before the character is allowed to play.  This ensures that the character fits into the game's theme and doesn't violate any rules.

Follow the game's instructions to set up the necessary information on your character and submit them for review.  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask on the chat channels.  The game administrators (the people who run the game) should be able to help you - that's what they're there for!
