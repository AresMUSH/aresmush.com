In this part of the MUSH 101 tutorial, we will cover how to find a game.

## A Place to Start

When it comes to traditional video games, you can visit your local game store or website and browse the titles until you find one you like.  Not so with MUSHes.  There is no authoritative list of games out there, and a lot of advertising is done through word of mouth.

So what's a new player to do?

Here are a number of MUSHes in different genres.  Hopefully one of them might appeal to you.  These are established games with sizeable player bases, and I have friends who recommend each of them.   

* [Game of Bones](http://gobmush.wikidot.com/) - Game of Thrones
* [Star Wars: Omens](http://www.sw-omens.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Star Wars
* [Serenity](http://wiki.serenitymush.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - Firefly
* [Witchcraft and Wizardry](http://wandw.wikidot.com/) - Harry Potter
* [No Return](http://noreturn.closetgamers.com/) - Post-Apocalyptic Zombies
* [Chicago](http://chicagomush.com/) - Roaring 20's Historical

If you don't see anything that grabs you in the list above, you have a couple of options:

* Try doing web searches for your favorite themes (like "Star Trek MUSH").  
* Visit one of the games above (or [AresCentral](/arescentral)) and see if there are any advertisements for other games.
* Check out the advertisements posted on [MU* Soapbox](http://musoapbox.net/).

## Learning More

Any game worth its salt will have a website to tell you everything you need to know about playing there.  The amount of information on a game's website can be overwhelming at first, but don't worry â€“ you don't need to read it all at once.  You'll usually find a good introduction to the game on the home page, or on a "Getting Started" or "Overview" link.

Browse around a little.  Read a few of the game policies.  It's okay if you don't understand them all just yet, because they use [MUSH jargon](/mush-101/mu-glossary), but make sure there's nothing that jumps out as a deal-breaker (like a minimum age requirement).

See if there's a gallery of current characters.  Read a few of their pages to see if they seem interesting.  Are these characters you would want to collaborate with to tell a story?   

> Many MUSHes let players pick an actor or actress to represent their character as a fun way for other players to immediately have an image of what that character is like.  You can think of it as the game's "dream cast".

## Taking a Look Around

Assuming the game looks interesting, the next step is to log in and have a look around.  To do this, you'll need to find the game's address.  This should be prominently displayed on their web page.  Remember, it takes a form like 'mush.aresmush.com port 7206'.

Just as we did in the [previous tutorial](/mush-101/connecting-and-commo), we'll use a Guest character.   Logging in as a Guest is a good way to get a feel for the game's community.   Check out the "who" list.  Are there many people to play with?  Does anyone greet you when you log in?  Are they friendly?

Let's check out *No Return*, the Zombie game.  Here's a short video illustrating the process:

Based on this visit, we've seen that No Return is friendly to guests, has a sizeable player base, and those players appear to be out playing with each other.  Those are all signs of a healthy game.

> All games have good nights and bad nights.  You may wish to observe the trends over the span of a week, and engage people in conversation to get a better feel for the game.

## Next Steps

Once you've found a game you want to play on, read the next step of the tutorial: [Joining the Cast](/mush-101/joining-the-cast).
