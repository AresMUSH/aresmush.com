So far we've dealt with the major commands needed to create your character and pose, but MUSHes have a host of other commands you should be aware of.  The following commands are available on virtually every MUSH out there.

> Many MUSH commands have a "+" or "@" in front of them for historical reasons - like +help or @describe.  On games using the AresMUSH engine, these prefixes are optional.

## Help

One of the most important commands is the in-game help command, because it will tell you how to use the other commands.    Type `+help` to see a list of commands and `+help <command>` to read a particular help file.

> As you can see, there are lots of other MUSH commands that aren't covered by this tutorial.  The help system will tell you all about them.

## OOC

The 'ooc' command is used to make an out-of-character comment to the other players in your room.  It's good for saying hello and goodbye when you enter or leave a room, and for making clarifications or corrections to poses.  `ooc <message>`.  OOC remarks are only visible to players in the same room.

## Finger/Profile/Info

There will be some sort of command for finding out about another character.  It will usually be named `+profile, +finger or +info`.  So for example:  `+finger <name>`

## Who and Where

`+who` will list the characters who are online. You can also use `+where` to see where they are and find out if there are scenes going on that you may be able to join.

## BBS

The BBS is an in-game public bulletin board system for important announcements.   Boards and posts are numbered for easy access.  The `+bbread` command will see what boards are available, `+bbread <#>` will view the messages on a particular board, and `+bbread <#>/<#>` will read a particular message.

## Mail

`+mail` is like an in-game email system, used for sending messages privately to various characters.  The `+mail` command will show you what messages you have and `+mail <#>` will read one.  Commands to send mail vary from game to game, but `+mail <name>=<subject>/<message>` usually works.

## Skills

Many games have some sort of skills/ability system.  You can use this system to resolve conflicts.  For example, if two characters get into a barfight, you could have them both roll their 'Brawling' skill to see who wins.   Often times this command is simply `+roll <skill>`, but consult the in-game help files for more information about the game's ability system.

## Next Steps

Congratulations!  You've now got everything you need to get out there and start playing.   You may also want to check out the [MUSH Glossary](/mush-101/mu-glossary) when you encounter unfamiliar terms.   Have fun!
