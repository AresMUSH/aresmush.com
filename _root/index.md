AresMUSH is a new kind of server for MUSH games.  Don't know what a MUSH is?  It's a unique style of text-based online gaming that blends role-playing games and collaborative writing.  Check out our [MUSH 101 Tutorial](/mush-101) to learn more.

From a player's perspective, AresMUSH is a sibling of PennMUSH and TinyMUX.  Many players have mistaken it for a custom version of Penn rather than a completely new server!  From an admin's perspective, it is something completely different.
