# AresMUSH

AresMUSH is a new kind of server for MUSH games.  Don't know what a MUSH is?  It's a unique style of text-based online gaming that blends role-playing games and collaborative writing.  Check out our [MUSH 101 Tutorial](/mush-101) to learn more.


From a player's perspective, AresMUSH is a sibling of [PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org/) and [TinyMUX](http://www.tinymux.org/). From an admin's perspective, it is something completely different.

> **Status:**  AresMUSH is still in development.  We have started early Alpha testing.  You can see Ares in action at [AresCentral](/arescentral).
