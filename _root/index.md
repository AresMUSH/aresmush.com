# AresMUSH

AresMUSH is a game engine for a style of text-based online gaming known as MUSHing.  From a player's perspective, AresMUSH is a sibling of [PennMUSH](http://www.pennmush.org/) and [TinyMUX](http://www.tinymux.org/). From an admin's perspective, it is something completely different.

> **Status:**  AresMUSH is still in development.  We have started early Alpha testing.  You can see Ares in action at [AresCentral](/arescentral).

Here are a few things to get you started:
