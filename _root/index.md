description: A New Breed of MUSH Server
layout: page

AresMUSH is a new kind of server for MUSH games.  Don't know what a MUSH is?  It's a unique style of text-based online gaming that blends role-playing games and collaborative writing.  Check out our [MUSH 101 Tutorial](/mush-101) to learn more.

From a player's perspective, AresMUSH is a sibling of PennMUSH and TinyMUX.  Many players have mistaken it for a custom version of Penn rather than a completely new server!  From an admin's perspective, it is something completely different.

> **Status:**  AresMUSH is still in development and not yet ready for general consumption.  The code is very much still a development sandbox and what's there now may not be compatible with what I do tomorrow.  You can see Ares in action at [BSG: Unification](http://bsgu.aresmush.com) and follow updates on the [blog](http://aresmush.wordspress.com) or [forum](http://forum.aresmush.com).
