Your privacy is important to us. 

Information you give to Ares Central is used to enable AresMUSH features, such as registration and admin commands.  For more information about how your handle information and friends lists are used, see [Player Handles](/handles).

We will not disclose your OOC information to a third-party (including other players) without your consent, except as required by law.  We will not use it to spam or hassle you.

> **Important!** We have no control over what individual game staff does with data on their own games.   Anything you type into a game window could potentially be stored.  You should consult the privacy policy of your games for more information.  If they don't have one, be wary.
