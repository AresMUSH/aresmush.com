Your privacy is important to us.  Here is the AresMUSH privacy policy, which applies to aresmush.com and [AresCentral](/arescentral).

> **Important!** We have no control over what individual AresMUSH game admins do with private MUSH data.  You should consult the privacy policy of your games for more information. 

## What We Store

AresMUSH stores a lot of information, but the things that are particularly relevant from a privacy standpoint are:

* Email address (if you provide one)
* Friends lists 
* Characters linked to your [OOC Player Handle](/handles).  
* IP addresses that you connect from. 

## What We Do With It

Stored information is used to enable AresMUSH features, such as registration and social commands.

We will not disclose your OOC information to a third-party (including other players) without your consent, except as required by law.  We will not use it to spam or hassle you.
