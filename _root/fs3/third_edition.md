# What's New in 3rd Edition

Here's a summary of what's new in FS3 3rd Edition.

* Ratings go from 1-5 instead of 1-12.
* Attributes have been replaced by Aptitudes, which give you bonuses to certain rolls.
* Background Skills have been split into Expertise (for things you're good at) and Interests (for things you dabble in).  Both are unrated, like Languages.
* Advantages are new, to reflect special things the game wants you to spend points on.
* Quirks are gone, replaced by RP Hooks and Goals.

# Abilities

There are several kinds of abilities in FS3 that each work a little differently.

**Aptitudes** represent your natural strengths and weaknesses.   These are not skills, but represent your 'knack' for certain things.

> Examples:  Athletics, Tech, Personality, etc.

**Action Skills** represent your ability in areas deemed important for gameplay. 

> Examples:  Firearms, Melee, Piloting, etc.

**Expertise** represents things your character is good at that are **not** already covered by Action Skills.  This is normally used when your career skills are not action-oriented.

> Examples: In a Western, a reporter could have an Expertise in journalism.  In Battlestar, a scientist might have an expertise in their field of study.

**Interests** represent hobbies and things your character dabbles in but isn't particularly skilled at.

> Examples:  A sport, a hobby, playing a musical instrument, or some other special interest.

**Advantages** are used on some games for things that aren't skills.  Some games won't use advantages at all.

> Examples:  Wealth, Political Influence, Superpowers.

**Languages** let you speak other languages.

# Ratings

Most things in FS3 are rated on a scale from 1-5, where the ratings have the following meanings:

| Rating | Summary | Description |
| ---- |
| 0 | Untrained / Abysmal | No ability at all in a skill.  With aptitudes, this would represent a disability. |
| 1 | Learning / Poor | You've got some basic know-how. |
| 2 | Competent / Average | Thoroughly competent. You succeed in most routine situations. |
| 3 | Seasoned / Good | Some experience and/or talent.  You can face challenging situations. |
| 4 | Expert / Great | A veteran in your field with lots of experience.  You can pull through even in dire circumstances. |
| 5 | Elite / Awesome | You have mastered your field.  Few can compare to your ability. |

> Note:  Elite doesn't mean "best of all time".   To use a sports analogy, Elite would mean an All-Star quality player, not necessarily the greatest player who ever lived.

# Ability Rolls

Abilities help you flesh out your character, but sometimes you'll need to use them to resolve conflicts.  Ability Rolls are used to determine the outcome of a character’s action, whether it’s shooting a gun or jumping a chasm.

> **The Golden Rule of Ability Rolls:**  As long as there are no objections from anyone involved in the scene, it is perfectly acceptable to just assume success or failure based on roleplay.

Action Skills, Expertise, Interests and Advantages can all be rolled if you have a rating in the ability.  You can apply a + or - modifier to adjust your rating for special conditions.

> `roll Firearms` to shoot a gun  
> `roll Firearms-1` to shoot at something really far away

Your rating determines how many dice you get to roll, and modifiers simply add or take away dice.  If you really want to know the details, see Dice Mechanics.

## Aptitudes and Defaulting

You can **default** to an Aptitude when you don't have a rating in an appropriate ability **as long as** your character would reasonably have a shot at it.  You can't do brain surgery without training, but you could default to your Athletic aptitude to run a footrace.

> **Note!** If the task is covered by an Action Skill, you can't default to an Aptitude.  Roll the skill even if you don't have it.  So if you pick up a gun without training, you roll Firearms, not Reactive.  The system will make an Untrained roll with a small chance of success.


# Character Creation

You get 20 points to spend on your character.

## Aptitudes

Aptitudes have no point value or cost.  Everyone gets to:

* Pick 1 thing you're naturally Great at
* Pick 1 thing you're naturally Good at
* Pick 1 thing you're naturally Poor at
* All others are average

## Action Skills

Action skills are rated from 1-5, and cost **1 point per rating**. 

## Expertise

Expertise skills cost **2 points each**.  They have no rating, but when you roll them, they are treated as a rating 4.

> Note:  You don't need to be awesome at something to have an Expertise, but if it's just something you dabble in, it should probably be an Interest instead.

## Advantages

Advantages are rated 1-5 like skills, but the meaning of each rating will be defined by the individual game.   They cost **1 point per rating**.

## Interests

You may take **up to 4 interests for free**, and must take at least 1. Any additional interests cost 1 point each.  Interests have no rating, but when you roll them, they are treated as a rating 2.

> Note:  If it's something you're really good at, it should probably be an Expertise instead.

## Languages

Languages cost 1 point each, but you get at least one for free.   Fluency is assumed, but you're free to RP a lower competence if you like.

## Rounding the Edges

In addition to the stats above, in chargen you also have to set:

* At least one **RP Hook**, which is something that might give other players a way to interact with you.  This could be something from your past, or something unusual or interesting about your character that might draw attention.
* At least one **Goal** your character wants to achieve.
* Your **Description**.
* Your **Demographics** (age, height, hair color, etc.).
* Your **Background** - a short (couple paragraphs max) description of who your character is and how they came to be here.

# Dice Mechanics

FS3 uses 10 sided dice, rolled against a target number of 8.

Number of Dice to Roll:  **twice** the skill rating, plus a modifier for the related aptitude.

| Aptitude | Modifier |
| ---- | |
| Great | 3 dice | 
| Good | 2 dice |
| Average | 1 dice |
| Poor | 0 dice |

When rolling an expertise, use a skill rating of 4.

When rolling an interest, use a skill rating of 2.

When defaulting to an aptitude, use a rating based on the related aptitude.  The aptitude modifier is not counted in when defaulting.

| Aptitude | Default Rating |
| ---- | |
| Great | rating 3 | 
| Good | rating 2 |
| Average | rating 1 |
| Poor | rating 0 |


## Dice Rolled



| Related Aptitude | Aptitude Only | Action 1 | Action 2 / Interest | Action 3 | Action 4 / Expertise | Action 5
|-----|
| Poor | 1 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10
| Average | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11
| Good | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12
| Great | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13

## Success Chance

Here's your rough chance of success given the number of dice rolled.   Modifiers just add and remove dice.

| Dice | Success Chance | |
| ---- | | |
| 1 | 30% |  |
| 2 | 51% | Average Defaulting |
| 3 | 65% |  |
| 4 | 75% |  |
| 5 | 83% | Average Action 2 / Interest |
| 6 | 88% |  |
| 7 | 91% |  |
| 8 | 94% |  |
| 9 | 95% | Average Action 4 / Expertise |
| 10+ | 98% |  |

> Note:  Above 10 dice, having more dice doesn't really increase your success chance, but it does protect you against negative modifiers.  In other words, someone with 12 dice can stand to lose 2 and still have a 98% chance of success.  Someone with only 10 dice who loses 2 drops to 94%.

I also just wanted to give a special shout-out to PirateSpice and Boo for their help crafting the 3rd edition and the crew of their sandbox game for being my guinea pigs.
