FS3 is a generic roleplaying game skills system, specifically designed and optimized for online text-based RPGs (MUSHes).  In Ares, FS3 is implemented as a family of plugins which all interact with and depend on each other.

* [Skills](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3skills)
* [Character Sheet](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3sheet)
* [Experience (XP)](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3xp)
* [Combat](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3combat) 
* [Luck](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3luck)

The [Chargen](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/chargen) plugin is also related, though it is general enough that it can apply to systems other than FS3.

## Why FS3?

What makes FS3 different from other skill systems? 

* A lean skill list. Most skill systems offer a bewildering array of skills, making character creation a chore. FS3 focuses on the skills that are truly relevant to the game.  Character creation is fast and easy.
* A streamlined dice system. The FS3 dice system is designed for MUSHing. On the whole, characters succeed more often than they do in other systems.
* A roleplay-friendly combat system. The FS3 combat system is designed to be fast and flexible, providing some colorful tactical options without bogging roleplay down in a lot of mechanics.
