FS3 (Faraday's Simple Skill System) is RPG system designed for MUSHes.  While inspired by traditional tabletop RPGs, it has some important differences.   These are the hallmarks of FS3:

* **Fast and Easy** - FS3 takes a simple approach to abilities and highlights skills that are relevant to gameplay.  The goal is to get you through Chargen and reviewed as fast as possible.

* **Predictable** - FS3 dice mechanics are less random than many other game systems.  Chance is still a factor, of course, but fluke results are less common.

* **Roleplay-Friendly** - FS3 has a lightweight conflict resolution and combat system that leaves a lot open to player interpretation.  This frees you to focus on the story, not the dice.

# FS3 and Ares

FS3 comes standard in AresMUSH.  It is implemented as a family of plugins which all interact with and depend on each other.

* Skills
* Character Sheet
* Experience (XP)
* Combat
* Luck

The Chargen plugin is also related, though it is general enough that it can apply to systems other than FS3.

# Player Guides

**[Third Edition](/fs3/fs3-3/)** is the current version of FS3.  The documentation is web-based.
