FS3 (Faraday's Simple Skill System) is RPG system designed for MUSHes.  FS3 is:

* **Fast and Easy** - FS3 takes a simple approach to abilities and highlights skills that are relevant to gameplay.  The goal is to get you through Chargen and reviewed as fast as possible.

* **Roleplay-Friendly** - FS3 has a lightweight conflict resolution and combat system that leaves a lot open to player interpretation.  This frees you to focus on the story, not the dice.
