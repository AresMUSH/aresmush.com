FS3 is a generic roleplaying game skills system, specifically designed and optimized for online text-based RPGs (MUSHes).  In Ares, FS3 is implemented as a family of plugins which all interact with and depend on each other.

* [Skills](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3skills)
* [Character Sheet](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3sheet)
* [Experience (XP)](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3xp)
* [Combat](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3combat) 
* [Luck](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/fs3luck)

The [Chargen](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush/tree/master/game/plugins/chargen) plugin is also related, though it is general enough that it can apply to systems other than FS3.

## Why FS3?

What makes FS3 different from other skill systems? 

* Differentiating between action skills and background skills, to highlight skills that are relevant to gameplay.
* Dice rolls that are optimized for MUSH play.
* A roleplay-friendly combat system.
