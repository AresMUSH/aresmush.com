Here are the success chances for the various skill levels, assuming an average attr (2) and routine difficulty:

1 - 57%       2 - 68%        3 - 76%        4 - 82%
5 - 86%       6 - 89%        7 - 93%        8+ - over 95%


TOTAL DICE

3 - 57%       4 - 68%        5 - 76%        6 - 82%
7 - 86%       8 - 89%        9 - 93%        10+ - over 95%


Once you've hit proficient (4), you're not going to fail very often.  Once you hit veteran (7) you'll hardly fail at all on a routine check.  

Now by "routine" I mean "routinely-challenging".  A roll isn't called for at all unless there's some sort of conflict or drama involved.   You wouldn't roll driving to drive to the grocery store on a sunny day.  A routine roll would involve someone stopping suddenly in front of you or getting up a snowy hill.   I would consider myself a veteran driver, because I am able to navigate those sorts of situations with at least 93% success.

One result of this is that you can get pretty decent competence just by having a couple dots in a skill.  That's why I discourage people from taking high skills for their hobbies.  When I review an app, any background skill over 3 gets scrutinized. Did they really mean to be professional level at that?

Skills above 7 don't really improve your base chance of success, which is why that sort of min-maxing doesn't bother me.  What they do is provide a cushion against modifiers, and an edge in contested rolls.

Success chances in FS3 are *deliberately* higher than what you might expect from a comparable skill in a tabletop RPG system, because they're not rolled as often.  If you are playing tabletop and roll 6 perception checks a night, you're going to be much more tolerant of dice fluctuations.  On a MUSH, when you roll 1 perception check a month, failures really irritate people.

FS3 stands for Faraday's *Simple* Skill System.   It's designed to let people get through chargen quickly and easily.   That is why there's no graded scale for point costs in chargen.  Skipping "common knowledge" skills, limiting the number of background skills you're expected to buy, limiting the choice of action skills, giving people essentially just four skill level choices (Novice, Proficient, Veteran, Master) ... these are all things that are designed to enhance the simplicity.

How well they work is open for debate :)  But that's the *idea*, anyway.
