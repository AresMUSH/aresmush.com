> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:**  Abilities in FS3 are deliberately broad to simplify chargen, but chances are your character isn't great at *every single thing* covered by a given skill.  For example, Medicine covers a lot, but a paramedic can't do brain surgery, and a brain surgeon or psychiatrist would suck trying to splint a broken leg.  RP appropriately according to your background, and apply appropriate modifiers (described in [Specialties](/fs3/fs3-3/conflict#specialties) when going out of your comfort zone.

## Background Skills

Background Skills are free-form, so there is no specific list.  You can pick anything from Singing to Underwater Basketweaving. Here are some sample Background Skills appropriate for **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

* A **science** - astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics, etc.
* A **humanity** - history, literature, psychology, philosophy, poetry, etc.
* A **profession or trade** - cook, waitress, bartender, accountant, programmer, carpenter, brewer, blacksmith, etc.
* A **game** - chess, roleplaying, poker, etc.
* An **art** - sculpting, painting, sketching, photography, etc.
* A **form of expression** - acting, singing, dancing, playing an instrument, writing, etc.
* A **sport** - baseball, football, gymnastics, etc.
* A **craft or hobby** - gardening, basketweaving, knitting, etc.
* An **unusual interest** - detective novels, game show hosts, etc.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have basic common knowledge (equivalent to the Everyman rating) in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.

## Language Skills

In FS3 Core, languages are free-form.  The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.

## Experience

TBD
