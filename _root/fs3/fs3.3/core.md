Background Skills are free-form, so there is no specific list.  You can pick anything from Singing to Underwater Basketweaving. Here are some sample Background Skills appropriate for **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

* A **science** - astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics, etc.
* A **humanity** - history, literature, psychology, philosophy, poetry, etc.
* A **profession or trade** - cook, waitress, bartender, accountant, programmer, carpenter, brewer, blacksmith, etc.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have basic common knowledge (equivalent to the Everyman rating) in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.

## Language Skills

In FS3 Core, languages are free-form.  The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.
