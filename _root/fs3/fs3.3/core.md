> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** In FS3 Core, Action Skills are deliberately broad to simplify chargen.  You should always roleplay appropriately to your character's specialties, and apply negative modifers if deviating beyond them.

## Background Skills

Background Skills are free-form, so there is no specific list.  You can pick anything from Singing to Underwater Basketweaving. Here are some sample Background Skills appropriate for **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

* A **science** - astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics, etc.
* A **humanity** - history, literature, psychology, philosophy, poetry, etc.
* A **profession or trade** - cook, waitress, bartender, accountant, programmer, carpenter, brewer, blacksmith, etc.
* A **game** - chess, roleplaying, poker, etc.
* An **art** - sculpting, painting, sketching, photography, etc.
* A **form of expression** - acting, singing, dancing, playing an instrument, writing, etc.
* A **sport** - baseball, football, gymnastics, etc.
* A **craft or hobby** - gardening, basketweaving, knitting, etc.
* An **unusual interest** - detective novels, game show hosts, etc.

> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have basic common knowledge (equivalent to the Everyman rating) in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.

## Language Skills

In FS3 Core, languages are free-form.  The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.

## Advantages

There are no Advantages in FS3 Core.

## Experience

You gain 2XP per week.

You can only raise one ability each week.

Raising abilities costs a different amount of XP depending on the type and level, as explained below.

###  Action Skills

|~ Current Rating |~ Cost |
| 0 | 2 XP |
| 1 | 4 XP |
| 2 | 8 XP |
| 3 | 16 XP |

You cannot raise a skill above 4 through XP.  Why?  Because becoming awesome at something takes **years** and games just don't run that long.

### Attributes

|~ Current Rating |~ Cost |
| 1 | 8 XP |
| 2 | 16 XP |
| 3 | 32 XP |

You cannot raise an attribute above 4 through XP.  This is simply a game-balance issue.

###  Background Skills

You can add or update a background skill at a cost of 2XP.  However, you may not progress beyond a professional level of competence (on par with rating 4) with XP.

### Specialties

Adding a specialty to an Action Skill costs 4XP.

### Languages

Learning a language costs 16XP.

## Luck

Everyone starts with 1 Luck Point.  You gain more from other players through the cookie RP reward system.  Every cookie translates into a fraction of a luck point.
