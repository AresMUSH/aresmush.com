An Ability Roll is used when you want to know if you succeed or fail at a given task using one of your Abilities.   You roll (virtual) dice based on how good you are, and the result determines the outcome.

<a name="when-to-roll"/>

# When to Roll

Ability Rolls should be used judiciously. RPGs are about *role*play not *roll*play.  It is not necessary to roll for every single thing.  You should consider using an ability roll if the character is: 

* Under significant stress.
* Facing challenging circumstances.
* In conflict with another character.

# Hail Mary Rolls

Rolling dice is fun and all, but it's also important to consider what your character *actually knows* and can *reasonably have a chance to accomplish*.  

You cannot do brain surgery with *Everyman* Medicine or fly a space shuttle with *Everyman* Piloting.  You cannot turn a cow's ear into a silk purse or leap a giant chasm no matter how well you roll.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  **Tip:** Common sense should always trump die results.

A storyteller may allow you to spend one or more [Luck Points](/fs3-3/luck) to get a "Hail Mary" roll out of blind luck even when one would not normally be allowed.

<a name="what-to-roll"/>

# What to Roll

Before rolling, you need to figure out which Skill applies best to the task at hand.  When more than one applies equally well, you can choose the one with the highest rating.  If you don't have an applicable Skill, you can make a *Default Roll* as explained in the next section.

FS3 uses 8-sided dice.  You roll a number of (virtual) dice equal to the Skill Rating plus the linked Attribute.  You can gain or lose dice through special Modifiers.   

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  **Tip:** Dice to Roll = Skill Rating + Linked Attribute +/- Modifiers

Languages and Background Skills aren't normally rolled.  If you really need to, they have rating equivalents as described in [Character Generation](/fs3/fs3-3/chargen).

<a name="defaulting"/>

# Defaulting

If a task does not fall under an ability listed on your character sheet, you may still attempt a Default Roll if the task would fall under common knowledge or is somewhat related to a skill you do have.  You have two options:

* Use a semi-related skill at -3.  For instance, if you lack a Vet skill you could default to Medicine-3 to treat a hurt dog.
* Use the Everyman rating to fall back on 'common knowledge'.  This effectively rolls Attribute + 1.

<a name="specialties"/>

# Specialties

Specialties restrict what your character can do with an ability.  If you use a skill outside of one of your specialized ares, apply a -3 modifier the same as if you were defaulting.  

If the task is too far outside your specialty (like a paramedic attempting brain surgery or a helicopter pilot trying to fly a space shuttle), then you shouldn't roll at all unless the Storyteller is allowing a Hail Mary.

<a name="success-level"/>

# Success Level

When you roll your ability dice, any die that is a 6 or higher is counted as a success.   It only takes one success to accomplish what you set out to do.  Extra successes mean you did really well.   You can think of success levels like letter grades on a school exam.  Did you scrape by with a passing grade or score top marks?

| Rating | Description |
| ---- |
|*|Embarrassing Failure|
|0|Failure|
|1-2|Success|
|3-4|Good Success|
|5-6|Great Success|
|7+|Amazing Success|

An Embarrassing Failure happens when more than half your dice are 1’s - even if you got some successes.   You don’t just fail, you fail is a spectacular and embarrassing fashion - like shooting your friend or falling flat on your face.

<a name="modifiers"/>

# Modifiers

Modifiers can boost or reduce your Ability Rating, making the task easier or harder than usual.  When considering modifiers, bear in mind that 3 rating points is the difference between a beginner and a professional, so a modifier of +/-3 is a pretty dramatic impact.

| Modifier | Description |
| ---- |
|+/- 1|Modest boost or challenge|
|+/- 2|Significant boost or challenge.|
|+/- 3|Extreme boost or challenge.|

A couple special situations:

* Spending a [Luck point](/fs3/fs3-3/luck) gives a +3 modifier.
* Defaulting gives a -3 modifier.
* Carefully taking your time (assuming there's no immediate danger/stress) or having special preparations gives a +2 modifier.

Here are some sample modifiers for a climbing roll:

| Modifier | Description |
| ---- |
|0|Climbing a tree.|
|-1|Climbing a slippery obstacle course wall.|
|-2|Climbing a challenging mountain.|
|-3|Remember Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 2?|

# Linked Attributes

Each Action Skill is linked to a particular Attribute, but there may be times when another Attribute is better suited.  For example, Firearms is normally a Reflexes skill, but Wits might be more appropriate when trying to identify the caliber from a bullet wound.  When you specify an attribute in the roll, it replaces the one that would normally be used.

<a name="opposed-rolls"/>

# Opposed Rolls

When someone is directly opposing you, you don’t just need to do well, you need to do *better* than the opponent.  That’s where Opposed Rolls come in.

Each contestant makes a roll as normal, and the one with the most successes wins.   It is also possible that nobody gets any successes and they both fail.  To determine how well the winner did, you look at the "net" successes - the *difference* between the winner and the loser:

| Net Successes | Description |
| ---- |
|0|Draw|
|1|Marginal Victory|
|2|Solid Victory|
|3+|Crushing Victory|

> Example: Nemesis and Mavros are sparring.  They both roll Melee.  Nemesis gets 2 successes (Good Success) and Mavros gets 1 success.  Nemesis has a net of 1 success, giving her a Marginal Victory.

# Teamwork

Up to three characters can combine their efforts toward a single task.   One character is designated the leader, and will make a single roll for the group.  The other characters each make a separate Assist Roll first to see if they can modify the Group Roll.

| Assist Result | Group Roll Modifier |
| ---- |
| Failure | -1  |
| Success | +1  |
| Good Success | +2  |
| Great Success | +3  |
| Amazing Success | +4  |

The modifiers for the Assist Rolls are added together and applied to the leader's Group Roll.  The maximum total modifier for the Group Roll is +4, no matter how well everyone succeeds.

> Example: Elodie and Zoe are assisting Tug with a Repair roll. Elodie and Zoe each roll Repair first, and get a Good Success (+2) and a regular Success (+1).  This lets Tug roll Repair+3 for the Group Roll.
