For those who care about the nitty-gritty about what the Ability Ratings actually mean in terms of chance of success, this article is for you.

## Base Mechanic

The basic FS3 mechanic is Attribute + Skill number of 8-sided dice against a target number of 6.

## Routine Roll

On a routine roll (no modifiers), here is the chance of getting at least one success at various Ability Ratings.

| Total Dice | Chance of Getting at Least 1 Success |
| ---- |
|1|37%|
|2|60%|
|3|75%|
|4|84%|
|5|90%|
|6|94%|
|7|96%|
|8|97%|
|9|98%|
|10|99%|

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Notice that it doesn't take many dice to get a high chance of success.  You might wonder why one would even bother to raise a skill higher than that.   Here's why...

## Hard Roll

With a -2 modifier, things get very different.

| Total Dice | Chance of Getting at Least 1 Success |
| ---- |
|1-3|37%|
|4|60%|
|5|75%|
|6|84%|
|7|90%|
|8|94%|
|9|96%|
|10|97%|

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Higher ratings insulate you against modifiers, letting you have a good chance of success even when the going gets tough.

## Multiple Successes

Also consider the chance of getting 2 or more successes (a "Good Success") on the roll at various ratings.

| Total Dice | Chance of Getting at Least 2 Successes |
| ---- |
|1|0%|
|2|14%|
|3|31%|
|4|48%|
|5|61%|
|6|72%|
|7|80%|
|8|86%|
|9|~90%|
|10|~96%|

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Higher ratings give you a better chance of getting multiple successes, which is particularly important when you start dealing with opposed rolls.

## Compared to Other Systems

One of FS3's claims is that you succeed more often compared to many other systems.  Here is the evidence of that.  You succeed *way* more often than you do in D20 and FUDGE/FATE.  nWoD is pretty close, but FS3 still has a slight edge.

| Person | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE/FATE | FS3.3 | 
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nate the Newbie | skill 1 (dex 11) | firearms 1 + dex 2 | Mediocre -1 | Amateur (3) | 
| Pete the Professional | skill 4 (dex 11) | firearms 3 + dex 2 | Good  +1  | Professional (6) | 
| Victor the Veteran | skill 8 (dex 11) | firearms 4 + dex 2 | Great +2  | Veteran (7) | 
| Maria the Master | skill 13 (dex 11) | firearms 5 + dex 2 | Superb +3  | Elite (9) |
