Experience is the way a character grows and changes over time.   FS3 experience works with a simple mechanic:

* Characters gain Experience Points (XP), which 'unlock' the potential to raise abilities.
* Raising abilities costs different amounts of XP, depending on the type and current rating.
* There may be timers or other limits to prevent raising a whole flurry of things all at once.

The exact mechanism for gaining XP and the cost of ability raises will vary from game to game depending on the game's desired tone, theme and values.

You can look at **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)** for an example.
