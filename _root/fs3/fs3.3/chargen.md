Character creation in FS3 is meant to be quick and easy.

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:**  In-game, use the `sheet` command to view all of your character's abilities, and the `app` command to review your sheet for problems.  The `app` command is the same one that staff will use when reviewing your character, so it's a good way to get a heads-up about what they might object to.

# Background

**Who are you?**  This is the most important question when designing a FS3 character.  It drives every Ability you take.  A disconnect between your background and your skills is the fastest way to raise a red flag when your character is reviewed.

# Demographics

You will need to set some basic demographic information about your character, such as their age, rank, faction, etc. 

# Power Level

In FS3, not all characters are equally “powerful”.  A Navy SEAL might exist alongside an 18-year-old marine fresh out of boot camp, or a master alongside an apprentice.  FS3 represents this by assigning each character a Power Level (PL).

## Calculating Power Level

Rather than being given a fixed number of points to spend in character creation, your character is assigned a Power Level based on the total number of Chargen (CG) Points you spend.  Different kinds of Abilities cost different CG points, as explained in **Choosing Abilities**, below.

| CG Points | Power Level | 
| ---- | 
| TBD | Inexperienced |
| TBD | Normal |
| TBD | Expert |
| TBD | Larger than Life |

## Why Play an Lower-Powered Character?

Dice are fun, but *story* is the most important thing.  Maybe you really want to tell the story of the young recruit.  And John McClane in *Die Hard* wasn't particularly powerful, but he's one of the most badass action heroes ever.  Teamwork, mentoring, niche skills, or just being in the right place at the right time can give even the lowest-powered character a chance to shine.   

Also, lower PL characters get a bonus when gaining [experience points](/fs3/fs3-3/xp) during the game.

## Power Level Restrictions

A game may restrict higher power levels by alt, by faction or any other criteria.  Some PLs may be off-limits completely.  Consult your local game policies for details.

> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** If your character is too powerful, ask staff for guidance.  They may be able to help you adjust your points or re-work your concept to one that better fits the theme.  Avoid shaving essential skills just to save points.  A Navy SEAL without the right skills is as much of a red flag as an overpowered character.

# Choosing Abilities

The following sections will guide you in determining your Abilities.

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:**  The system will automatically assign you some starting Abilities based on your character's faction/position.  These are generally skills that everyone should know, so be sure to have a good reason before lowering a skill below its starting rating.  Even these starting Abilities count towards your Power Level.

## What Are Abilities?

Be sure to read the [System Basics](/fs3/fs3-3/basics) document for an overview of the different kinds of abilities and what they represent.

## Talents

Allocate Talent Dice to the areas you think represent your greatest talents.  Remember, a talent of 0 doesn't mean you suck; it just means you don't gain a bonus to your skill rating for those sorts of skills.

Each Talent die costs **2 CG Points**.

You may have at most **6 Talent Dice**.

## Action Skills

All characters must have a rating in all Action Skills; you don't just get to leave some off your sheet.

A recommended way to approach Action Skills is simply to go down the list one by one and ask:  **What level bests describes my character?**  If the descriptions in the rating table above aren't clear, you can use the [Detailed Ratings](/fs3/fs3-3/detailed-ratings) as a guide.  

Higher skill ratings cost more than lower ones.  Generally, ratings 4 or higher are professional-level skills, and should only be taken if your character is truly good enough to do this for a living.

| Rating | CG Point Cost |
| ---- |
| 1-2 | Free | 
| 3-5 | 1 CG Point Each |
| 6-8 | 2 CG Points Each |

You may have at most **3 Action Skills rated 6+**.  Nobody can be awesome at everything.

> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** Why don't you get anything for taking a rating 1?  This is to discourage min/maxing.  A rating 1 is unusual.  It means that the character lacks even the basic knowledge that the average person in the game world has.  Such a decision should not be made lightly just to shave a point here and there.

## Background Skills

Background Skills are free-form, so there is no specific list.  You can pick anything from Singing to Underwater Basketweaving.  See the [System Basics](/fs3/fs3-3/basics) document for some ideas.

> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have the **Everyman** rating in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.  You are, of course, free to roll Unskilled if your character has never picked up a football in his/her life.

You must take **at least 1** Background Skill, and can take **up to 3 for free**.

Additional Background Skills cost **1 CG Point** each.

## Languages

Your first language is free.   Any additional languages cost **1 CG Point** each.

## Traits

All characters must have a rating in all Traits; you don't just get to leave some off your sheet.

| Rating | CG Point Cost |
| ---- |
| 1-2 | Free | 
| 3-4 | 1 CG Point Each |
| 5 | 2 CG Points |

> <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** As with Action Skills, rating 1 costs the same as rating 2 to discourage min/maxing.  If you really want to be bad at something, that should be a roleplay choice not a rollplay choice.

# RP Hooks

The final step in character creation is to set at least one **RP Hook**.  This is something interesting about your character that others can leverage for RP ideas.   Do you have a short temper?  Is your family famous so that someone might recognize you?   Do you love (or hate) dogs or small children?   Just about any personality trait, quirk or background tidbit can be a RP Hook.

# Review

Once you have finished your character, they will be reviewed by the application staff to ensure there are no problems.  Then you'll be able to hit the grid and play.
