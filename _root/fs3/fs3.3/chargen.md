Character creation in FS3 is meant to be quick and easy.

# Concept

**Who are you?**  This is the most important question when designing a FS3 character.  It drives every Ability you take.  A disconnect between your concept and your skills is the fastest way to raise a red flag when your character is reviewed.

# Ability Points

**Ability Points (AP)** are a way of measuring the sum total of your character's abilities.  Every ability you pick and every rating you choose contributes toward your total AP rating.

Different kinds of abilities cost different number of AP, as explained in **Choosing Abilities** below.  Action-oriented things are given more weight than background things, simply because they're far more likely to come up during the course of the game.

## Point Restrictions

You don't start off with a fixed pool of AP.  Instead, the system counts **up** how much you've spent to give you an AP total.  

A game may restrict the maximum allowable AP by alt, by faction or any other criteria.  Consult your local game policies for details.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** If your character uses too many AP, ask staff for help.  They may be able to help you adjust your points or re-work your concept to one that better fits the theme.  Avoid shaving essential skills just to save points.  A character missing essential skills is as much of a red flag as an overpowered character.

## AP Disparities

Some characters will have higher AP totals than others.   Is that fair?  Sure it is, as long you realize that it's the player's choice.  Characters in FS3 have equal *opportunity*, but ultimately you pick what you want to play.   

The system is designed so that abilities central to the game's "action" cost more than other abilities.  A Navy SEAL will obviously have more action-oriented skills than a master cook (unless the cook is also Stephen Seagal).  They're both great at what they do - one just needs more AP to get there.

But why would you want to play a lower-powered character in the first place?   Why not maximize your allowable AP rating?

Dice are fun, but *story* is the most important thing.  Telling a story about a wide-eyed young recruit or sidekick can be fun.   And John McClane in *Die Hard* wasn't particularly powerful, but he's one of the most badass action heroes ever.  In the right story, everyone can have a chance to shine.

# Choosing Abilities

The following sections will guide you in determining your Abilities.

<a name="attributes"/>

## Attributes

Attributes represent basic abilities that everyone has to some extent.  Attributes boost related skills, and come into play when no skill directly applies.  See [Conflict Resolution](/fs3/fs3-3/conflict) for details.

The specific list of Attributes will vary from game to game.  For an example, see **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

### Attribute Ratings

Attributes are rated from 1-4.

| Rating | Summary | Description |
| ---- |
|1|Poor|You are below average.  (less than 40th percentile)|
|2|Average |You are about average.  (40-60th percentile)|
|3|Good|You’re better than average.   (60-80th percentile)|
|4|Exceptional|You’re considerably above average. (more than 80th percentile)|

### Buying Attributes

You receive *Average* in all Attributes for free.  Each additional rating costs **2 APs**.

You may spend at most **14 APs** on Attributes.  You may not have more than **2 Attributes rated 4**.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You don't gain any points for taking a rating 1 in an Attribute.  It costs the same as rating 2.  Rating 1 is there solely for roleplay flavor if you want to denote a disadvantage.

<a name="action-skills"/>

## Action Skills

Action Skills represent your training/knowledge in areas that are likely to come up in action/conflict situations during the game.  For more details about using skills, see [Conflict Resolution](/fs3/fs3-3/conflict).

The specific list of Action Skills will vary from game to game.  For an example, see **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

### Action Skill Ratings

Action Skills are rated from 0 to 8, based on your training and experience.

| Rating | Summary | Description |
| ---- |
|0 |Unskilled|You grew up in a cave or something and know absolutely nothing about this. |
|1 |Everyman|You know what the average inhabitant of the game world would know.   |
|2 |Fair|You've still got a lot to learn, but you can handle easy stuff. |
|3 |Competent|You have competence at a junior-professional level, but lack finesse or experience.|
|4 |Good|You are thoroughly competent at a general professional level. |
|5 |Great|You understand nuances and shortcuts, and can handle even challenging situations with ease. |
|6 |Extraordinary|You are an expert, and can pull through even in dire circumstances. |
|7 |Amazing|You have mastered your field and few can compare. Example: an All Star athlete or world-renowned scientist.|   
|8 |Legendary|You are one of the best that’s ever lived.  Example: Einstein or Beethoven. |

If the descriptions in the rating table above aren't enough, you can use the [Detailed Ratings](/fs3/fs3-3/detailed-ratings) as a guide.  

A few tips about Action Skills:

* Competent/Good/Great are professional skill levels, so most of your job-related skills should be in this range.
* You don't have to be amazing to succeed in FS3.  Ratings 6+ are exceptional.
* Your skills should generally match your professional experience.  While some variation is allowed for talent (or lack thereof), be careful not to stray too far.  A brand-new pilot with an Amazing piloting skill isn't going to fly (pun intended).

<a name="unskilled"/>

### Everyman vs. Unskilled

The 'Everyman' rating covers the average layperson's ability.  Even for a specialty skill like medicine or piloting, that's going to mean _some_ amount of knowledge.   Someone with Everyman piloting probably knows to pull back on the stick to make the plane go up.  Everyman medicine means knowing to put ice on a bruise and how much aspirin to take.

Unskilled is when you're really hopeless - worse that average.    For example, in the 100 universe there are people from a space station interacting with people from a post-apocalyptic Earth.  The Grounders know nothing about technology, so it would make sense for them to have Unskilled in tech skills and firearms.  Similarly, most of the Arkers from the space station are Unskilled in Earth-based survival skills.

Most settings will not need to distinguish between Unskilled and Everyman.

### Specialties

Some Action Skills are so broad that you need to pick a specialty.  For instance, your paramedic's "Medicine" skill might be really good, but it doesn't cover brain surgery.  If you take a specialized ability higher than Fair, you must choose a specialty.

### Buying Action Skills

You automatically get the *Everyman* rating in each Action Skill for free.  Each additional rating costs **1 AP**.

You may have at most **3 Action Skills rated 5+**, **2 rated 6+** and **1 rated 7+**.  These limits apply to the total number of skills, so if you have a 6 and a 7, that counts as both 1 at 7+ and 2 at 6+.

If you have a specialized ability higher than Fair, you must choose a specialty.  The first one is free.  Every additional specialty costs **1 AP**.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You don't gain any points for taking a rating 0 in an Action Skill.  It costs the same as rating 1.  Rating 0 is there solely for roleplay flavor if you want to denote a disadvantage.  Bear in mind that this disadvantage is significant.  "Everyman" represents your average person.  For example - Everyman in piloting is someone who maybe saw some movies and played a flight sim game.  Lower than that would be pretty low indeed.

<a name="background-skills"/>

## Background Skills

Background Skills represent arts, sports, hobbies, professions and any other skills not covered by Action Skills.  

Valid Background Skills will vary from game to game.  For an example, see **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)**.

### Background Skill Ratings

Background Skills have a compressed rating system, because it isn't necessary to fret over whether your baseball hobby is at a 2 or a 3:

* **Fair** - Interests and casual studies.  For example: playing in a bar league, a hobby, some college or equivalent study that never went anywhere.
* **Good** - Professional or semi-professional competentence.  For example: a minor league or college athlete, a serious hobbyist, a college degree with some professional experience.
* **Exceptional** - Notable expertise in your field.  For example: a Major league athlete, an advanced degree, a renowned expert.

A few tips for selecting Background Skills:

* You are assumed to have the equivalent of Everyman rating in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet.  Don't feel obliged to list every single thing your character has ever done - focus on the things that are important to you.
* Background Skills can be broad, within reason.  "Electrical Engineering" is sufficient for a degree in engineering; you don't need to take individual skills for Math, Physics, Statistics, etc.  Just avoid super-broad things like "Art" or "Science".

### Buying Background Skills

You must take **at least 1** Background Skill.  You can have up to **6 rating points** of Background Skills for free.  Additional Background Skills cost **1 AP** each.

<a name="languages"/>

## Languages

Languages represent the languages that your character can speak and/or read.   The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.

### Language Ratings

Like Background Skills, Language Skills have more descriptive ratings.  

* **Beginner** - You know tourist-level common phrases like "my name is" and "where's the bathroom".  Rolled as Fair (2).
* **Conversational** - You can get by, but your phrasing is sometimes awkward and your vocabulary incomplete.  Rolled as Good (4).
* **Fluent** - You are fully fluent in the language.  Rolled as Exceptional (6).

Your reading level is assumed to be on par with your speaking level, unless otherwise specified.

## Advantages

Advantages are used on some games to represent things a character has that are not skills - resources, rank, connections, etc.  Valid Advantages will vary from game to game.  Some games may not use them at all.

### Advantage Ratings

Advantages have compressed ratings like languages and background skills.  The precise meaning of each rating should be set by the game admin, since advantages mean different things on different games.

* **Fair** 
* **Good** 
* **Exceptional** 

### Buying Advantages

Advantages cost **2 AP** per rating by default, but individual games can adjust this cost.
