Luck Points in FS3 are a way to give your character a "quirk of fate" edge. They can be used in different ways.

## Ability Rolls

You can spend Luck Points in various ways to help your ability rolls.

* Before your own roll, spend a point to receive a +3 modifier.
* Before someone else’s roll (friend or enemy), spend a point to apply a +3 or -3 modifier to their roll.
* Immediately after your own roll, spend a point to get a re-roll and choose the better of the two rolls.
* Spend a point to cancel a luck point used against you (for example: if someone gave you a modifier you can spend a luck point to avoid it).

Only one Luck Point can apply to a given roll, so you can’t give yourself a bonus and someone else a penalty in the same Opposed Roll.	Also, you can’t have multiple people all spending luck to help the same person.

## Combat

You can spend a Luck Point for special effects.  See **[Combat](/fs3/fs3-3/combat#luck)**.

## Plot Points

You can also spend Luck Points to affect the outcome of plots. For example: you might spend a point to have the prosecutor lose key evidence in a trial, or to get a lucky break finding a missing witness. This is entirely at the Storyteller’s discretion, and the number of points required will vary based on how much you’re pushing your luck.

## Getting Lucky

How you gain luck will vary from game to game.  See **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core)** for an example.
