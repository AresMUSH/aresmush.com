Luck Points in FS3 are a way to give your character a "quirk of fate" edge. They can be used in different ways.

Ability Rolls
You can spend a Luck Point to get a temporary +3 modifier to a single ability roll.

Combat
You can spend a Luck Point to:

• Modify attack, defense or initiative Ability Rolls. Note: You may only modify one roll per combat turn.
• Recover from a Knockout.
• Move an injury from one hit location to another. Note: This must be done immediately after the injury, and does not affect the damage done; it is purely for cosmetic/roleplay reasons.

Plot Points
You can also spend Luck Points to affect the outcome of plots. For example: you might spend a point to have the prosecutor lose key evidence in a trial, or to get a lucky break finding a missing witness. This is entirely at the Storyteller’s discretion, and the number of points required will vary based on how much you’re pushing your luck.

Getting Lucky
Everyone starts with 1 Luck Point. You accumulate more through the cookies system. Admins can also grant Luck Points as special rewards.
