---

Experience Points (XP) reflect how your character grows and changes over time.  FS3 is designed for moderately-gritty games.  Skill progression is slower than in many RPG systems because it takes a long time to become an expert in something.  You can pick up new skills that you've learned on-camera pretty easily, but in general your skills are going to be relatively static.

# Gaining XP

XP is gained at a fixed rate of **1 XP per week**.  This number is affected by an **XP Multiplier** based on your character's Power Level.  As you spend XP and become more powerful, your Power Level will rise and your XP gain will slow.

| Power Level | XP Multiplier |
| ---- | 
| Inexperienced | x2 |
| Normal | x1 |
| Expert | x0.5 |
| Superstar | x0.25 |

## Training

XP costs already assume that you're getting some kind of training, so you don't get any special bonus just for having a teacher. 

There are certain immersive training environments, like flight school or boot camp, that a character might experience on-camera that warrant faster learning.  Staff may award bonus XP in these situations, or simply raise the appropriate skills directly.

# Raising a Trait

Raising a Trait costs a number of XP based on the new level.

| New Level | XP Cost | Rough Time |
| ---- |
| 2 | 4 | 1 month |
| 3 | 8 | 2 months |
| 4 | 24 | 6 months |
| 5 | 52 | 1 year |

# Raising an Action Skill

Raising an Action Skill costs a number of XP based on the new level.

| New Level | XP Cost | Rough Time |

# Learning a Background Skill

Picking up new hobbies is relatively easy, so it only takes **4 XP** to add a new Background Skill to your sheet.

# Learning a Language

It takes **4 XP** to add a new Language to your sheet, but this reflects only a rudimentary knowledge.  It takes a long time to get fluent, so you should RP accordingly.
