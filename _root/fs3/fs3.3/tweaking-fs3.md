This article gives some tips to game designers for customizing and tweaking FS3.

# Attributes

The six attributes are designed to cover the basic aspects of a character.  There are two for physical strength/finesse (Brawn and Reflexes), two for mental strength/finesse (Grit and Wits), and two that are a blend of physical and mental (Perception and Presence). 

When changing attributes, consider that every skill - even a Background Skill - needs to be tied to an attribute.  That's why Presence exists even though it isn't relevant to Action Skills in FS3 Core.  It's there so you have something to link Background Skills like Acting or Seduction to.

# Action Skills

One of the hallmarks of FS3 is the distinction between Action Skills, which are relevant to the conflict in the game, and Background Skills, which are fluff skills to promote character depth. Another hallmark is a fast, easy character creation experience because the skill list is limited.

The most important thing with Action Skills is to keep the list reasonably small.  10-12 skills is ideal.  More than that, and you're going to end up with people min/maxing excessively or getting overwhelmed trying to figure out what skills they need.  Fewer than that, and you won't have much differentiation between characters.

Limit Action Skills to what is **important** to your game and likely to come up in **conflict** situations.  Sure, Survival and Driving and Riding are all potential Action Skills.  But are there really going to be a lot of challenging horseback rides or car chases in your theme?  Are people going to be stranded out in the woods a lot?   If it's not important, leave it to a Background Skill.

Attributes aren't meant to be rolled by themselves; only in conjunction with a skill.  So if you expect something like a willpower or perception check to come up a lot in your game, you should have an Action Skill to go with it - like Composure or Alertness.

# Specialties

FS3 works best with broad Action Skills, because otherwise you end up with a gazillion of them.  Of course there are specialties within every Action Skill.  Firing a pistol is really not quite the same as using a rifle, nor is wielding a sword the same as wielding an axe.  These are lumped together for simplicity.  Remember - FS3 is "**Simple** Skill System".   

Don't add specialties for every skill or it gets silly.  Reserve them for the ones that truly need some degree of oversight.  On a BSG game it might be important to know whether your pilot knows Vipers, Raptors or both.  On a modern game, does it really matter what kinds of planes they can fly?  Probably not.

# Ability Point Limits

One of the common criticisms of FS3 is that it encourages min/max-ing in chargen.  In large part this is due to people not having enough points in chargen to make the character they want to make.  So they have to shave points in chargen and buy them up later with XP.

This is silly.  If you're not going to allow enough points to support a particular concept, then **don't allow that concept**.  There's nothing wrong with telling people to start off at "level 1" - MMOs and tabletop RPGs have been doing it for ages.  But "level 1" characters should have an appropriate "level 1" background.  It makes no sense to allow a Navy SEAL or superhero character and then nerf their skills.

## Setting Limits

The default limit of 45 AP in FS3 Core is designed around these factors:

* 8 AP to raise a few attributes to above-average levels.
* 6 AP to get the 3 "everybody has them" abilities (Athletics, Composure, Alertness) to at least amateur level.
* 5 AP to cover the 'basic training' military skills that everyone has.
* 8 AP to get two profession-specific action skills to professional levels.
* 18 AP to spread around other things to make you cool.

If you have substantially more "everybody has them" abilities or more than two profession-specific skills, you should consider raising the bar accordingly.

Don't be afraid to allow different levels of Ability Points based on faction, position, or some other criteria that makes sense in your game.  In 3rd Edition, Action Skills account for **way** more of the Ability Point total.  So action-oriented characters need more points than supporting characters.

## Points and Age

Side note about age:  I'm not a fan of flat age brackets.  You end up with a lot of people who min/max their age to get points instead of picking the age that's appropriate to their concept.  And age doesn't always equal experience.  Should a 50-year-old cook really have as many Action Skills as a 22-year-old marine combat veteran?  No.  But should a 40-year-old Navy SEAL veteran of five tours have more Action Skills than an 18-year-old marine fresh out of boot?  Absolutely.

# Ratings

Games are encouraged to use the full range of ability levels, with the exception of the **Legendary** skill level, which is truly meant to reflect epic levels of awesomeness.

Too often, games curtail people.  For example, refusing to approve rookie pilots with low skills or veteran pilots with high skills.  When you do that, you effectively take a game that's tuned for dice ranges from 2-12 and smush it down into 4-9.  Everyone starts to blend together.

There's really not a huge advantage between higher skill levels once you get above 5.  Don't be too worried that you're going to hugely unbalance the game by allowing a couple 6's.

# Experience / Advancement

There is no universal approach to character advancement.  It varies a great deal depending on the game's desired tone, theme and values.  That said, there are a few common models:

* **Carrot on a Stick** - You feed people a continual stream of adancement as an incentive to keep playing.   This is what you find in many traditional RPGs and MMOs.
* **Hero's Journey** - Characters get really good really quick because they're heroes.  The hero begins the journey as a farmer/apprentice/etc. and by the end of the (typically very short) journey they're a legend.
* **Reward-Based** - If you do things that the staff approves of, you will advance faster.
* **Realistic** - Learning takes time.  Lots of time.  You may pick up a new hobby here or there, but in the IC timespan covered by a typical MUSH at a 1:1 time ratio, character skills aren't going to meaningfully change.

There is no right or wrong here; it is a question of style and preference.  But there are a few caveats:

* Characters who start out as newbie/apprentice type characters are going to be very frustrated if they're expecting the Hero's Journey and you're enforcing a more realistic rate of advancement.  Talk to these players ahead of time to set appropriate expectations.
* If you limit chargen points too much *and* enforce a slow progression model, you're basically begging people to min/max their skills in chargen.
* It's a bit jarring to restrict starting levels in chargen ("sorry, you don't have enough experience to justify a rating 6 in that skill") and then let characters advance to level 6 in a few months of game play.
* Carrot on a stick model works best when people start off at low levels (as MMOs/tabletop RPGs do).  When you let people start as experts and *still* expect continuous advancement, you can quicly reach godlike power levels.  It can also lead to some glaring disparities between veteran characters and people fresh out of chargen.
* Reward-based advancement can lead to OOC sour grapes if people are unable/unwilling to do certain things due to time/temperment/etc.  It can also create a have/have-not splintering of power levels.

All of these reasons are why FS3 Core takes an approach of giving you lots of points to start off cool if you want to be an expert, but then has slow advancement thereafter.

# Combat Abilities

The combat rules require you to determine which abilities are used for the following rolls:

- Knockout (default = Composure)
- Recovery, aka natural healing (default = Athletics)
- Medicine (default = Medicine)
- First Aid (default = Medicine)
- Repair (default = Technician)
- Initiative (default = Composure)

# Dodge

This is a pet peeve of mine, so take it with a grain of salt :)

Please don't add a Dodge skill.  For one, it makes warriors now need to buy *one more skill*, which just causes more min/maxing and silliness in chargen.  Secondly, nobody ever goes into a martial arts dojo just to learn "Dodge".  Splitting out dodge makes about as much sense as splitting out punching or kicking.  It also doesn't account for parries/blocks very well.

The main reason people end up adding it is because they break up Melee into multiple skills.  Since weapons have a single defense skill, you get into a jam when you've got a guy with a sword attacking a guy with an axe.  

First off, question whether you really need to break up Melee in the first place.  Go back to the advice on Action Skills and keeping the number down. 

But if you really must, just make a small tweak to the defense skill code.  Make a small change to the "determine defense skill" function in the code so that melee weapons defend with a skill appropriate to the weapon the attacker is wielding.

# Customizing Weapons

Creating a weapons list is obviously important for the game. Consider whether you really want to make up different models of weapons (M16 Assault Rifle, AK47 Assault Rifle, etc.) or just lump everything into a generic category (Assault Rifle). It can be tedious creating all the statistics, and having too many weapons to pick from can either be overwhelming or cool depending on your player base.

Most of the weapon statistics are pretty self-explanatory, A few bear special mention:

| Weapon Stat |  Notes|
| ---- |
| Weapon Type | May be melee, ranged, explosive or suppressive (used for ECM/jamming weapons or things like flash or smoke grenades). |
| Attack Skill | The skill used for attack rolls. |
| Defense Skill | The skill used for defense rolls.  For firearms, it is recommended that you use a raw ability level of “3” rather than any specific skill. Stance reflects your defensive choices, and nobody is really any better at dodging bullets than anybody else.  |
| Lethality | Lethality is a % increase to weapon damage.  |
| Penetration | How effective the weapon is at penetrating armor. See **Armor** below. |
| Damage Type | Stun or Physical.  Stun wounds are for bruises and shocks that don't last long. |
| Ammo | How many times a weapon can fire before it has to be reloaded. |
| Auto Fire | Whether the weapon is capable of burst fire. |
| Recoil | If the weapon does burst fire, what is the modifier for each bullet after the first.  1 is a good number for modern rifles. 2 for SMGs or weapons with worse recoil. |
|Shrapnel|Whether the weapon does shrapnel damage.  Anti-vehicle weapons are typically armor piercing and do not do shrapnel damage. Anti-personnel weapons usually have shrapnel. |

# Customizing Armor

The key to selecting armor values is to keep protection values balanced relative to the weapon penetration values. Evenly-matched penetration/protection values mean that there's about a 50/50 chance of the weapon getting through.

| Armor Stat |  Notes|
| ---- |
| Protection | This is a list of hit locations and protection values.  Armor can have different protection in different areas, to reflect weak spots. |

See **[How Armor Works](/fs3/fs3-3/combat-mechanics#armor)** for more info.

# Customizing Vehicles

Here is a guide for customizing vehicle stats:

| Vehicle Stat |  Notes|
| ---- |
| Piloting Skill | The skill used to pilot the vehicle. Has no game effect; it’s just for reference. |
| Toughness | Use the same scale as personal ability levels (2-13).  Used for knockout rolls. |
| Armor | Specify which type of armor (from the armor list) applies to this vehicle. |
| Hit Location Chart | Specify which hit location chart (from the hit location chart list) applies to this vehicle. |
| Weapons | Standard weapons loadout for the vehicle. This is just a guide, not a restriction, since there may legitimately be multiple weapons loadouts. |
| Defense Bonus | A modifier applied to defense rolls while piloting the vehicle. May be a penalty if negative. Set values from +3 to -3 to reflect nimble or lumbering craft.|

# Customizing Hit Locations

Each hit location chart has a number of stats you can adjust:

| Hit Location Stat |  Notes|
| ---- |
| Lethality | A list of hit locations and lethality bonuses for each location.  For instance, an arm might have a negative lethality, making flesh wounds more likely in that location. |
| Crew Areas | For a vehicle hit chart, these are the locations that have a potential for inflicting crew damage. |
| Default Target | The default hit location, usually the center of mass. |
| Targets | See below. |

FS3 uses a somewhat unique hit location system.  See **[How Hit Location Works](/fs3/fs3-3/combat-mechanics#hit-location)** for more info on how it works and some examples of how to set up the target locations.

# Customizing Combatant Types

The system lets you specify custom combatant types beyond the standard "soldier", "pilot", "passenger".  Each custom type can be assigned a default weapon, hit location chart, armor type and vehicle type.   You can use this for different kinds of troops (e.g. Archer vs Spearman) or for creatures and alients (e.g. Centurion or CylonRaider).
