There is no universal approach to character advancement.  It varies a great deal depending on the game's desired tone, theme and values.  That said, there are a few common models:

* **Carrot on a Stick** - You feed people a continual stream of adancement as an incentive to keep playing.   This is what you find in many traditional RPGs and MMOs.
* **Hero's Journey** - Characters get really good really quick because they're heroes.  The hero begins the journey as a farmer/apprentice/etc. and by the end of the (typically very short) journey they're a legend.
* **Reward-Based** - If you do things that the staff approves of, you will advance faster.
* **Realistic** - Learning takes time.  Lots of time.  You may pick up a new hobby here or there, but in the IC timespan covered by a typical MUSH at a 1:1 time ratio, character skills aren't going to meaningfully change.

There is no right or wrong here; it is a question of style and preference.  But there are a few caveats:

* Characters who start out as newbie/nugget/apprentice type characters are going to be very frustrated if they're expecting the Hero's Journey and you're enforcing a more realistic rate of advancement.  Talk to these players ahead of time to set appropriate expectations.
* If you limit chargen points too much (preventing people from building the type of characters they want to in the first place) *and* enforce a slow progression model, you're basically begging people to min/max their skills in chargen.
* Carrot on a stick model works best when people start off at low levels (as MMOs/tabletop RPGs do).  When you let people start as experts and *still* expect continuous advancement, you can quicly reach godlike power levels.  It can also lead to some glaring disparities between veteran characters and people fresh out of chargen.
* Reward-based advancement can indeed reward desired behavior, but can also lead to OOC sour grapes if people are unable/unwilling to do certain things due to time/temperment/etc.  It can also create a have/have-not splintering of power levels.


Whereas many RPGs force you to start off at lower levels and advance over time, FS3 lets you *start out* as an expert.  With an emphasis on story and a slant towards moderately-gritty games, skill progression is far slower in FS3 than in other systems.

What about higher levels?  If you've got a game that runs for years and years, the admin can create house rules for advancement beyond Veteran.  However, for the lifespan of a typical game, it's simply out of reach.  People don't become experts or legends in a year or two.
