+ Attributes

The six attributes are designed to cover the basic aspects of a character.  There are two for physical strength/finesse (Brawn and Reflexes), two for mental strength/finesse (Grit and Wits), and two that are a blend of physical and mental (Perception and Presence). 

When changing attributes, consider that every skill - even a Background Skill - needs to be tied to an attribute.  That's why Presence exists even though it isn't relevant to Action Skills in FS3 Core.  It's there so you have something to link Background Skills like Acting or Seduction to.

+ Action Skills

The most important thing with Action Skills is to keep the list reasonably small.  10-12 skills is ideal.  More than that, and you're going to end up with people min/maxing excessively or getting overwhelmed trying to figure out what skills they need.  Fewer than that, and you won't have much differentiation between characters.

Limit Action Skills to what is **important** to your game and likely to come up in **conflict** situations.  Sure, Survival and Driving and Riding are all potential Action Skills.  But are there really going to be a lot of challenging horseback rides or car chases in your theme?  Are people going to be stranded out in the woods a lot?   If it's not important, leave it to a Background Skill.

Attributes aren't meant to be rolled by themselves; only in conjunction with a skill.  So if you expect something like a willpower or perception check to come up a lot in your game, you should have an Action Skill to go with it - like Composure or Alertness.

+ Specialties

FS3 works best with broad Action Skills, because otherwise you end up with a gazillion of them.  Of course there are specialties within every Action Skill.  Firing a pistol is really not quite the same as using a rifle, nor is wielding a sword the same as wielding an axe.  These are lumped together for simplicity.  Remember - FS3 is "**Simple** Skill System".   Players are afforded a degree of trust to ensure that their characters are RPing appropriately, and not having their paramedic char perform brain surgery even though they have Medicine 5.

But if you *really really want* to enforce specialties, here's the recommended way to do it:

* List specialties for each Action Skill on the chargen list.  For example, Melee might have Blades, Blunt, Unarmed, Thrown.
* Characters get 1 specialty for free when they buy the skill in Chargen.
* Additional specialties cost either 1AP in chargen or 8XP after chargen.

If you want to limit specialties further, you can say that they can't buy a second specialty until their skill is at 4 (Professional) and can't buy a third one until their skill is at 6 (Expert).

If you're using a skill outside one of your specialties, it is effectively the same as defaulting and you should apply a -2 modifier.  But if the specialties aren't related at all (like using Pilot/Helicopter to fly a space shuttle) a Hail Mary roll is more appropriate.

+ Ability Point Limits

One of the common criticisms of FS3 is that it encourages min/max-ing in chargen.  In large part this is due to people not having enough points in chargen to make the character they want to make.  So they have to shave points in chargen and buy them up later with XP.

This is silly.  If you're not going to allow enough points to support a particular concept, then **don't allow that concept**.  There's nothing wrong with telling people to start off at "level 1" - MMOs and tabletop RPGs have been doing it for ages.  But "level 1" characters should have an appropriate "level 1" background.  It makes no sense to allow a Navy SEAL or superhero character and then nerf their skills.

Also don't be afraid to allow different levels of Ability Points based on faction, position, or some other criteria that makes sense in your world.  In 3rd Edition, Action Skills account for **way** more of the Ability Point total.  So action-oriented characters need more points than supporting characters.

Side note about age:  I'm not a fan of flat age brackets.  You end up with a lot of people who min/max their age to get points instead of picking the age that's appropriate to their concept.  And age doesn't always equal experience.  Should a 50-year-old cook really have as many Action Skills as a 22-year-old marine combat veteran?  No.  But should a 40-year-old Navy SEAL veteran of five tours have more Action Skills than an 18-year-old marine fresh out of boot?  Absolutely.

The best way to set your upper Action Point limit is to try to make up the most powerful action-oriented character you want to allow in your game.  See how many APs they need, and make that the upper bound.  That doesn't mean that everyone should spend that much.  But it does mean that anybody who goes beyond it is making a concept that's too powerful.

+ Experience / Advancement

There is no universal approach to character advancement.  It varies a great deal depending on the game's desired tone, theme and values.  That said, there are a few common models:

* **Carrot on a Stick** - You feed people a continual stream of adancement as an incentive to keep playing.   This is what you find in many traditional RPGs and MMOs.
* **Hero's Journey** - Characters get really good really quick because they're heroes.  The hero begins the journey as a farmer/apprentice/etc. and by the end of the (typically very short) journey they're a legend.
* **Reward-Based** - If you do things that the staff approves of, you will advance faster.
* **Realistic** - Learning takes time.  Lots of time.  You may pick up a new hobby here or there, but in the IC timespan covered by a typical MUSH at a 1:1 time ratio, character skills aren't going to meaningfully change.

There is no right or wrong here; it is a question of style and preference.  But there are a few caveats:

* Characters who start out as newbie/apprentice type characters are going to be very frustrated if they're expecting the Hero's Journey and you're enforcing a more realistic rate of advancement.  Talk to these players ahead of time to set appropriate expectations.
* If you limit chargen points too much *and* enforce a slow progression model, you're basically begging people to min/max their skills in chargen.
* It's a bit jarring to restrict starting levels in chargen ("sorry, you don't have enough experience to justify a rating 6 in that skill") and then let characters advance to level 6 in a few months of game play.
* Carrot on a stick model works best when people start off at low levels (as MMOs/tabletop RPGs do).  When you let people start as experts and *still* expect continuous advancement, you can quicly reach godlike power levels.  It can also lead to some glaring disparities between veteran characters and people fresh out of chargen.
* Reward-based advancement can lead to OOC sour grapes if people are unable/unwilling to do certain things due to time/temperment/etc.  It can also create a have/have-not splintering of power levels.
