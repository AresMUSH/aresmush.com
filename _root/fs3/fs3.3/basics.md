Characters in FS3 have **Abilities** to describe what they know and what they can do.  **Ability Ratings** are numbers that quantify the character's capabilities.  When conflicts arise, you can make an **Ability Roll** with virtual dice to determine the result.  

FS3 is a "count successes" system like nWoD or Shadowrun 4, where you roll a number of dice equal to the Ability Rating against a fixed target number.

# Abilities

**Abilities** describe what you can do.   There are several kinds of Abilities.   

> <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Code Tip:**  Use the `abilities` command in-game to see a list of availabile abilities.

## Action Skills

Action Skills represent your training/knowledge in areas that are likely to come up in action/conflict situations during the game. 

Here are the standard FS3 Action Skills and their linked Talents.  Individual games may customize this list.

* **Demolitions** - Blowing stuff up.  (Technical)
* **Firearms** - Shooting guns.  (Hand-Eye)
* **First Aid** - Patching people up in the field. (Technical)
* **Gunnery** - Ship and vehicle weapons.  (Hand-Eye)
* **Medicine** - Patching people up inside of a hospital. (Academic)
* **Melee** - Fighting with fists, knives, and hand-to-hand weapons. (Physical)
* **Piloting** - Flying Vipers, Raptors and other airborne vehicles. (Hand-Eye)
* **Repair** - Mechanical/electrical repair. (Technical)
* **Stealth** - Being sneaky. (Physical)

Action Skills are rated from 1 to 8, with the numbers representing *training* and *experience*.   Talent is factored in separately (see **Talents**, below), so even the most talented newcomer would still have a low skill rating.

| Rating | Summary | Description |
| ---- |
|1 |Unskilled|You lack even basic capabilities in this area.|
|2 |Everyman|You know what the average inhabitant of the game world would know.   |
|3 |Amateur|You are a hobbyist or student with some basic training.  |
|4 |Rookie|You're a junior professional, fully trained but lacking experience.|
|5 |Professional|You are a thoroughly competent professional.  |
|6 |Veteran|You are a seasoned professional with significant experience to drawn upon. |
|7 |Elite|You are one of the top people in your field.|   
|8 |Legend|You are one of the best that’s ever lived.|

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Roll Tip:** When rolling an Action Skill, you get a number of dice equal to the skill rating plus the talent bonus dice (1 to 10 dice total).

### The Everyman Rating

Rating 2 (Everyman) is a special rating.  It reflects what the average inhabitant of the game world would be capable of.  What this means will vary from skill to skill.  Everyman in Firearms is a lot different from Everyman in Nuclear Physics.  Both may get the same number of dice to roll, but what tasks they could conceivably even *attempt* with those dice is very different.  

Just use common sense.  You can't fix a rocket ship with Everyman Repair, no matter how well you roll, but you could try to fix the broken wheel on a cart.

## Background Skills

Background Skills represent arts, sports, hobbies, professions and any other skills not covered by Action Skills. 

Here are some sample Background Skills.  Individual games may customize this list.

* A **science** - astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics, etc.
* A **humanity** - history, literature, psychology, philosophy, poetry, etc.
* A **profession or trade** - cook, waitress, bartender, accountant, programmer, carpenter, brewer, blacksmith, etc.
* A **game** - chess, roleplaying, poker, etc.
* An **art** - sculpting, painting, sketching, photography, etc.
* A **form of expression** - acting, singing, dancing, playing an instrument, writing
* A **sport** - baseball, football, gymnastics, etc.
* A **craft or hobby** - gardening, basketweaving, knitting, etc.
* An **unusual interest** - detective novels, game show hosts, etc.

Background Skills are not rated.  They exist for RP flavor and character depth more than conflict resolution.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Roll Tip:** If you ever need to roll a Background Skill, you can pick a rating appropriate to your background.  Hobbies and interests should generally be Amateur, while professional skills should be Professional or Veteran.

## Talents

Talents represent your natural-born talent.  They give you anywhere from 0 to 2 bonus dice to related skills.  You have some flexibility in choosing which Talent applies to a given roll.  See [Conflict Resolution](/fs3/fs3.3/conflict).

Here are the standard FS3 talents and the sorts of skills they cover.  Individual games may customize this list.

* **Physical** - Physical skills involving agility and strength.
* **Hand-Eye** - Skills involving hand-eye coordination and reflexes.
* **Technical** - Skills that blend knowledge and craftsmanship.
* **Academic** - Intellectual pursuits involving logic and reasoning.
* **Creative** - Artistic and imaginitive skills.
* **Social** - Skills that involve interacting with and influencing others.

Because Talents are something you’re born with, they don’t change during the course of the game.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Roll Tip:** You don't roll Talents by themselves; they just add bonus dice to related skills. For example, someone with a Firearms skill of Amateur (3) and a related Hand-Eye talent of 2 would roll 5 dice.  They're still an Amateur - just an exceptionally good one.

## Languages

Languages represent the languages that your character can speak and/or read.   

Like Background Skills, Languages have no ratings.   If you have a Language, you’re assumed to be fluent and literate.  You can always RP a lower degree of proficiency if appropriate to your background.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Roll Tip:** You shouldn't ever need to roll a language if you are fluent.  If you are RPing a lesser proficiency and wish to make a roll, you may choose an appropriate rating.

## Traits

Traits represent Abilities that are not skills but are still important to the game.  You might find them as Attributes, Advantages or Backgrounds in other game systems.  

Here are the standard FS3 Traits.  Individual games may customize this list.

* **Perception** - Noticing things and being aware of your surroundings.  (Used for notice/search rolls.)
* **Composure** - Cooless under pressure.  Willpower.  (Used for initiative and resisting wounds in combat.)
* **Stamina** - Physical fortitude or toughness.  (Used for resisting wounds in combat.)

Trait ratings aren't as fine-grained as skill ratings.  They only go from 1-5 and are unaffected by Talents.

| Rating | Summary | Description |
| ---- |
|1|Poor|You are below average.  (less than 40th percentile)|
|2|Average |You are about average.  (40-60th percentile)|
|3|Good|You’re better than average.   (60-75th percentile)|
|4|Great|You are considerably above average.  (75-90th percentile)|
|5|Exceptional|You’re truly remarkable. (more than 90th percentile)|

These ratings are just a general guideline, and some games may assign specific meaning to levels of traits.  For instance, a rating 4 in a "Resources" trait might mean something very specific.

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Roll Tip:** When you roll a Trait, you get a number of dice equal to *twice* the rating (2 to 10 dice total).
