# What is FS3?

FS3 is RPG system designed for MUSHes.  While inspired by traditional tabletop RPGs, it has some important differences.   These are the hallmarks of FS3:

* **Fast and Easy Chargen** - FS3 takes a simple approach to abilities and highlights skills that are relevant to gameplay.  The goal is to get you through Chargen and reviewed as fast as possible.

* **Flexible Power Levels** - FS3 is designed for games with disparate power levels, where a young Marine recruit might be playing alongside a Navy SEAL or a master alongside an apprentice.   It doesn't punish people for being good at what they do.

* **More Predictability** - FS3 dice mechanics are less random than many other game systems.  Chance is still a factor, but the outcomes are generally more predictable and fluke results less common.

* **Roleplay-Friendly Combat System** - FS3 has a lightweight conflict resolution and combat system that leaves a lot open to player interpretation.  This frees you to focus on the story, not the dice.

## FS3 as a Framework

With just a few tweaks to the skill and weapons lists to make them fit the setting, FS3 can be used for anything from Wild West to Battlestar.  In this way, it is similar to generic RPG frameworks like D20 or FATE.

However, FS3 is designed with near-modern cooperative games in mind.  Before trying to adapt it to a different kind of game, consider the advice in [Choosing FS3](/fs3/fs3-3/choosing-fs3).

As with any RPG system, be aware that different games will have their own "house rules".

## FS3 as a Codebase

Since FS3 is designed for MUSHes, it is provided as a complete codebase.  FS3.3 is currently only available for AresMUSH.  Earlier versions were available for PennMUSH.

# What's New in Third Edition?

* Instead of a fixed number of chargen points, characters are assigned a Power Level to reflect the relative power of their abilities.
* Skill Ratings go from 1-8 instead of 1-12, with better descriptions of what the different levels represent.
* Attributes have been replaced by Talents, which give you bonus dice when rolling related skills.
* Traits are a new type of Ability that reflect miscellanous characteristics that don't fit as skills.
* Background Skills are now unrated, like Languages.
* Quirks are gone, replaced by RP Hooks.
* Various other tweaks to the dice, XP costs and gain, and more.
