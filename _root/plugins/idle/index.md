The Idle plugin helps you to deal with characters who have disappeared from the game.

In Ares, it is recommended that idled-out players be kept around if they've been approved.  Why?  Well, they're part of the IC world.  They might come back, and allowing their name to be re-used could mess up the game wiki references.  Database space should not be an issue unless your game is ginormous. (If it is, you can always purge people later.)
