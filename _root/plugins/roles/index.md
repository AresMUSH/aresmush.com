Instead of flags and powers, Ares supports a generic Roles system.

You can define whatever roles you want - admin, builder, guest, stormtrooper, viper pilot, etc. and then assign those roles to players.  Bulletin boards, exits, channels and commands can all be locked so only certain roles can access them. 

For more fine-grained control, roles can also have _permissions_ for individual commands.
