Every system in AresMUSH is implemented as a **Plugin**, even basic functionality like poses and movement.  This makes it easy to extend and customize Ares by adding, modifying or replacing any plugin. 

For example: A war MUSH might swap out the movement plugin for one that restricts movement based on action points during combat. A fantasy MUSH might swap out the description system with one that limits character descriptions based on what clothing items they had purchased. 

All changes *replace* the standard plugins, so you don’t end up with a hardcoded “who” and a softcoded “+who” on top of it.

Here are the plugins that come standard with AresMUSH.
