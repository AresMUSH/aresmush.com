Next you need to configure a few bits of basic server information.

From your MUSH server shell, type:

    cd aresmush (if you aren't there already)
    bin/configure

It should do some setup stuff and then prompt you to enter the game configuration. For example:

    Let's set up your database.  Please enter the requested information.
    Database host >

> Don't know what to enter?  Check out [Configuration Info](/install-ares/server-config).

You can run this command again later if you ever need to change the configuration. You can also skip the command and just edit the configuration files in the game/config directory manually.
