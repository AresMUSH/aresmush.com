If you don't want to use MongoLab, you can certainly use a different cloud host or even set up MongoDB on the same server as your MUSH.  

If you use one of these options, you will need to:

1. Install MongoDB or select a host that already has it installed.
2. Create the Ares database.
3. Make it private.
4. Create a user who can access it.

See the [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) website for help.
