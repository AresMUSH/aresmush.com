This tutorial will walk you through an AresMUSH installation from start to finish. It may seem like a lot, but step-by-step instructions with pictures and examples are intended to make the installation painless - even if you have no prior server admin experience.

If at any point you run into trouble, see [Getting Help](/feedback).

> **IMPORTANT STATUS:**  AresMUSH is still in development.  We have started early Beta testing.  Feel free to play around with Ares - I'd love your [feedback](/feedback) - but it is not yet ready to be used for real in a game.
