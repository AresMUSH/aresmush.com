Before we install Ares itself, there's a choice to make: are you going to be doing a lot of code?  

Ares is fully functional out of the box, with all the standard globals you'd expect and probably a bunch you didn't (you can see a full list [here](/code/plugins)).  You can have your game up and running in minutes just by tweaking a few configuration files.

For some games, that's enough, but others need whole new systems (like space or crafting) or serious tweaks to existing code (like adding email registration to login).  These folks will want to take a moment to do an extra step *now* to make their lives a lot easier in the future.

If you are sure you're making only **minimal** code changes, go [here](/get-code).

If you are planning on **extensive** code changes, or aren't sure, go [here](/fork-code). It will only take about ten extra minutes now to set things up, and it may save you lots of headaches in the future.  Better safe than sorry.
