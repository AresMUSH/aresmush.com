Ares is fully functional out of the box, with all the standard globals you'd expect and probably a bunch you didn't (you can see a full list [here](/code/plugins)).  You can have your game up and running in minutes just by tweaking a few configuration files.  For some games, that's enough, but others are going to want new systems or radical changes. 

> **Important!** If you know that you're going to be doing some heavy coding, or you expect to have multiple coders working on your game, you should take a moment now to create your own [independent version](/code/fork-the-code) of the Ares code.  It will only take a few extra minutes, and it will save you lots of headaches in the future.
