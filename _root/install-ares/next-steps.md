Congratulations! Your AresMUSH game should now be up and running.

Try connecting to it via your favorite MUSH client. Use the same hostname and port number you used in the server info configuration (e.g. mygame.somehost.com 4201).

## Troubleshooting

If you can't connect to the game, review the database.yml and server.yml files in `game/config` to ensure they're correct and check the log files in `game/log` for any error messages.  If none of that helps, see [Getting Help](/feedback).

## Default Characters

Ares comes with a "headwiz" character, akin to the "God" character on Penn and Tiny. 

    Username: Headwiz
    Password: change_me!

There's also a "builder" character:

    Username: Builder
    Password: change_me!

You can rename them if you like.  Be sure to log them in and change their passwords!

## Customization

Ares works out of the box, but there's a lot you can customize to get things just the way you like.  See [Customizing AresMUSH](/tutorials/customize-ares).
