Congratulations! Your AresMUSH game should now be up and running, and fully functional.

Here are a few places you can go from here.

## Headwiz Character

Ares comes with a "headwiz" character, akin to the "God" character on Penn and Tiny. 

    Username: Headwiz
    Password: change_me!

## Customization

Ares works out of the box, but there's a lot you can customize to get things just the way you like.

## Handling Restarts

You probably want to make sure your game restarts if the server ever reboots. See [Restart After Reboot](/manage/restart-after-reboot).
