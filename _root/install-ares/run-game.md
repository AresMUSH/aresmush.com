Now you're ready to start the game for real. From your MUSH server shell, type:

    cd aresmush (if you aren't there already)
    bin/startares

> The important difference between 'devstart' and 'startares' is that the latter will continue to run even after you log off. Startares is what you want to use for normal operation.

Try once again connecting to the game via your favorite MUSH client. Use the same hostname and port number you used in the server info configuration (e.g. mygame.somehost.com 4201).
