AresMUSH code lives in the [GitHub](https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush) version control system.  Version control helps you track and undo changes, coordinate multiple coders, and even serves as a backup system.  If you're not familiar with the idea of version control, here's a [great tutorial](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) explaining why it's awesome.

If you want to use version control for your own game code, GitHub makes it easy to create your own independent version (called a "fork") of the Ares code that you can then modify to your heart's content.  It only takes a few extra minutes now, and could save you a lot of headaches in the future.

> Forking the code is **strongly recommended** if you plan on making any big code modifications (like using a different skills system or adding economy code)

If you want to use GitHub for your game's version control, follow the instructions to [create your fork](/code/fork-the-code) and then come back here.
