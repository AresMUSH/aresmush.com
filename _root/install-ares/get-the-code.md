Log into your MUSH server shell and type this command to get the code.

> **Note:** If you created your own personal fork of Ares, you should use your own clone URL instead of the main one.  It will be something like https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/aresmush.git.  The clone URL can be found on your repository screen as explained in [Forking Ares](/code/fork-the-code#clone-url)

    git clone https://github.com/lynnfaraday/aresmush.git

The game will be put into a directory named "aresmush".  Any time you want to mess around with ares, you'll need to change into that directory on the server shell:

    cd aresmush
