Host names are optional - you can always connect to a game using its IP address.  But it's nice to have a host name so people can remember your game address more easily.

Some MUSH hosts may give you a host name (like yourmush.genesismuds.com) but Digital Ocean doesn't.  If you want a name, you'll have to set it up.

## Custom Domain

You can register a custom domain name (yourmush.com) for just a few dollars a year through sites like [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) and [1and1](http://1and1.com).   Once you have the domain registered, use the [Digital Ocean Host Name Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean) to set up your domain.

## AresMUSH Domain

You can also request an AresMUSH sub-domain (yourmush.aresmush.com) by [contacting me directly](/feedback).  AresMUSH sub-domains are given out at my sole discretion, and at no charge.
