While AresMUSH tries to preserve the player experience from PennMUSH and TinyMUX, the admin experience is something entirely different.

## Turnkey Installation
Setting up an Ares server is designed to be as painless as possible. The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions.

The basic Ares installation includes not only the server itself (like Penn and Tiny) but also a rich suite of Plugins. The standard plugins cover everything from channels to chargen, so you should have everything you need for a typical game.

## Easy Configuration

There's no need to mess around with attributes and objects to configure your game.  Everything is done through text-based configuration files.  And the tutorials will walk you through everything you need to do.

_Note: All basic configuration can be done through the config files, but if you need to do something highly specialized, you will probably need to dive into the code.  But don't worry - [coding for Ares](/features/ares-for-coders) is fun._

## A Real Database
Ares uses MongoDB, an up-and-coming database system. Using a standard database makes it easy to get at your data, make backups, or even integrate it (in a read-only fashion) with a website.

## Built-In Advertising
No need to log into a bunch of other games to post ads for your MUSH.  With the AresCentral game directory, your game's information will be available to everyone.  

_Note: Currently the game directory can only be viewed on [AresCentral](/arescentral), but eventually it will be available on all Ares games._

## International Support
Ares is designed with international games in mind. Currently only English is supported, but it is hoped that people will contribute translations for other languages as time goes on.
