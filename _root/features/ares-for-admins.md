While AresMUSH preserves the player experience from PennMUSH and TinyMUX, the admin experience is something entirely different.

## Turnkey Installation
Setting up an Ares server is designed to be as painless as possible. The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions, assuming no prior server management experience.

The basic Ares installation includes not only the server itself (like Penn and Tiny) but also a rich suite of [Plugins](/plugins). The standard plugins cover everything from channels to chargen, so you should have everything you need for a typical game.

## Easy Configuration

No need to mess around with attributes and objects to configure your game.  Everything is done through plain-text configuration, accessible through the game's website.  And the tutorials will walk you through everything you need to do.

_Note: If you need to do something highly specialized, you will probably need to dive into the code.  But don't worry - [coding for Ares](/features/ares-for-coders) is fun._

## FS3

AresMUSH comes with the [FS3 Skills and Combat System](/fs3) built in, but the plugins system enables you to strip that out and code your own system instead.

## A Real Database
Ares uses Redis, an up-and-coming database system. Using a standard database makes it easy to get at your data, make backups, or even integrate it  with a website.

## Built-In Advertising
No need to log into a bunch of other games to post ads for your MUSH.  With the AresCentral game directory, your game's information will be available to everyone.  

## International Support
Ares is designed with international games in mind, supporting translations and Unicode characters. Currently the game is only translated into English, but you can add your own translations.  If you are interested in sharing your translations, please [contact us](/feedback).
