While AresMUSH preserves the player experience from PennMUSH and TinyMUX, the admin experience is something entirely different.

## Turnkey Installation
Setting up an Ares server is designed to be as painless as possible. The tutorials provide step-by-step instructions, assuming no prior server management experience.

The basic Ares installation includes not only the server itself (like Penn and Tiny) but also a rich suite of [Plugins](/help). The standard plugins cover everything from channels to chargen, so you should have everything you need for a typical game.

## Easy Configuration

There's no need to mess around with coded attributes and objects to configure your game.  Everything is configurable through the game's Web Portal, and the tutorials will guide you through the process.

## Web Portal

The AresMUSH Web Portal lets you configure your game, view logs, and perform other common admin tasks with a nice web UI.

## FS3

AresMUSH comes with the [FS3 Skills and Combat System](/fs3/fs3-3) built in, providing a complete character creation and conflict resolution system.   The plugin system makes it easy to remove FS3, but of course you'd then have to code your own skills system.

## A Real Database

Ares uses Redis, a fast and lightweight database system. Using a standard database makes it easy to get at your data, make backups and integrate with the Web Portal.

## Built-In Advertising

No more spamming ads on bulletin boards.  With the AresCentral game directory, your game's information will be available to everyone.  

## International Support

Ares is designed with international games in mind, supporting translations and special characters (Unicode). Currently the game is only translated into English, but you can add your own translations and command aliases.

If you are interested in sharing your translations, please [contact us](/feedback).

> Note: The web portal is not fully localized, but if there's sufficient interest it will be considered.
