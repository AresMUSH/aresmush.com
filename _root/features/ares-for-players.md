AresMUSH strives to provide a similar player experience to PennMUSH and TinyMUX. But there are a few things that are new and improved.

## Commands

On Penn or Tiny, command names have historical significance. But new players are sometimes baffled by why it’s +finger vs @desc, or why there’s a difference between +who and WHO. On Ares, commands are intended to be more intuitive and consistent.

Commands in Ares have no prefixes. The who command is simply “who”. The combat command is simply “combat”. If you do accidentally type a prefix (@, +, or /), it’ll be ignored, so +who, @who and /who all end up being just “who”. Commands also have more intuitive names. The OOC profile command is ‘profile’, not ‘finger’. The command to build a room is ‘build’, not ‘dig’.

> **Oh no, not another set of commands!**

> Don’t worry if you’re an experienced MUSH player. Thanks to the shortcuts system, you’ll find that the command names you know and love should work just fine. In fact, Ares does its best to support both Penn and MUX syntax for common commands. So whether you like @chan/join or addcom, hopefully you’ll be content.

## Handles
Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games. Through your handle, people can identify you as a player, not just as a character. Read more about handles [here](/features/handles).

## Directory
The AresMUSH games directory will tell you all the AresMUSH games that have registered with the central server. It lists the game genre, description, and the last time it was online.

## Little Things
Ares tries to make players’ lives easier. Most of these are little conveniences, like a better AFK system and a clear delineation between IC and OOC command output, but hopefully it adds up to a more pleasurable experience overall.
