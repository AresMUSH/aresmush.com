AresMUSH is designed for players familiar with PennMUSH and TinyMUX.  Virtually all of the commands you're familiar with will work just as you expect.  

The [Ares for Vets](/ares-for-vets) tutorial gives a run-down on some of the differences between AresMUSH and Penn/Tiny.

## Commands

Commands in Ares are designed to be simpler and more approachable to new players, while at the same time preserving shortcuts for experienced players used to commands working a certain way.  Where possible, it supports both Tiny and Penn syntax for things like mail and channels.

## Handles
[Player Handles](/handles) bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games. Through your handle, people can identify you as a player, not just as a character.

## Directory
The AresMUSH games directory will tell you all the AresMUSH games that have registered with the central server. It lists the game genre, description, and the last time it was online.

## Little Things
Ares tries to make playersâ€™ lives easier.  These little conveniences, like a better AFK system and a clear separation between IC and OOC command output, add up to a more pleasurable experience overall.
