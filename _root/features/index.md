AresMUSH is designed with three goals in mind:

## Make it Easier to Create a Game

There’s an old saying for folks wanting to create a MUSH: “Step 1: Find a coder.” It’s true, but silly. Coding should be an afterthought, not your primary concern. The ultimate goal for Ares is to provide a complete MUSH in a box that can be installed and configured by people with no prior code experience.

## Make it Easier to Play

Ares is designed to offer a familiar experience to both Penn and TinyMUX players, so experienced players will feel right at home. At the same time, it tries make the commands more approachable to new players and old alike.

## Make it Easier to Code

Some games will need advanced customizations or theme-specific code. Traditional MUSH softcode is hard to learn and work with, and the server hardcode is difficult or impossible to change. Ares uses a high-level programming language (Ruby), and a plugin system to make coding easier, more flexible, and more pleasant.
