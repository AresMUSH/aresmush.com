AresMUSH is designed with three goals in mind:

## Make it Easier to Create a Game

There’s an old saying for folks wanting to create a MUSH: “Step 1: Find a coder.” It’s true, but silly. Coding should be an afterthought, not your primary concern. The ultimate goal for Ares is to provide a complete MUSH in a box that can be installed and configured by people with no prior code experience.  Ares includes:

* Turnkey Installation step-by-step [instructions](/install-ares).
* A rich suite of [Plugins](/plugins) with all the standard MUSH systems included out of the box.
* Easy configuration using plain text files.
* A real database, making it easier to do automated backups and web integrations.
* Built-in advertising through the AresCentral games list.
* Internationalization support for building a game in another language.

## Make it Easier to Play

Ares is designed to offer a familiar experience to both Penn and TinyMUX players, so experienced players will feel right at home. At the same time, it tries make the commands more approachable to new players and old alike.

* Consistent and intuitive commands with no prefixes (@, +, etc.)
* Shortcuts for veteran players so they can use the command names they're familiar with.
* Mail and channels do their best to support both MUX and Penn style commands.
* A better in-game help system.
* OOC [Player Handles](/handles) to identify yourself as a player, not just a character.
* Various little things to make a player's life easier, like a better AFK and IC/OOC status system.

## Make it Easier to Code

Some games will need advanced customizations or theme-specific code. Traditional MUSH softcode is hard to learn and work with, and the server hardcode is difficult or impossible to change. Ares uses a high-level programming language (Ruby), and a plugin system to make coding easier, more flexible, and more pleasant.

* Leave softcode behind and code in Ruby, a modern high-level language.
* Modify, extend or replace any plugin, including basic functionality like poses and movement.
