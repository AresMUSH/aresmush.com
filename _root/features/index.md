AresMUSH is designed with three goals in mind:

## Make it Easier to Play

Ares makes it easier to play for new and veteran MUSHers alike.

* A fully-integrated [website/wiki](/web-portal).
* A familiar experience for Penn and TinyMUX players.
* Player handles, which bring a taste of social media to MUSHes.
* A ground-up focus on making a pleasant user experience.

Ares is designed to offer a familiar experience to both Penn and TinyMUX players, so experienced players will feel right at home. At the same time, a fully-integrated  and streamlined commands make the game easier to play for new players and old alike.

## Make it Easier to Create a Game

Existing MUSH clients effectively require you to have a coder on board before you can make a game.  Coding should be an afterthought, not your primary concern. Ares makes it easier to create a game.

* Turnkey installation with automated scripts and step-by-step instructions.
* A complete MUSH-in-a-box that can be installed and configured by people with no prior code experience.
* A fully-integrated [Web Portal](/web-portal), so you don't need to manage a separate wiki.
* Easy web-based configuration.
* FS3 comes built-in, and several other [skill systems](/skills) are available as easy-to-install plugins.

## Make it Easier to Code

Some games will need advanced customizations or theme-specific code. Traditional MUSH softcode is hard to learn and work with, and the server hardcode is difficult or impossible to change. Ares code is easier to work with.

* Mainstream languages - Ruby (for the server) and JavaScript (for the web portal)- that are easier to learn and get help with.
* A robust plugin system that makes it easy to change core functionality.
