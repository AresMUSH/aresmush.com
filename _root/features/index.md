AresMUSH is designed with three goals in mind:

## Make it Easier to Play

Ares is designed to offer a familiar experience to both Penn and TinyMUX players, so experienced players will feel right at home. At the same time, a fully-integrated [Web Portal](/web-portal) and streamlined commands make the game easier to play for new players and old alike.

## Make it Easier to Create a Game

Existing MUSH clients effectively require you to have a coder on board before you can make a game.  Coding should be an afterthought, not your primary concern. Ares provides a complete MUSH-in-a-box that can be installed and configured by people with no prior code experience.

## Make it Easier to Code

Some games will need advanced customizations or theme-specific code. Traditional MUSH softcode is hard to learn and work with, and the server hardcode is difficult or impossible to change. Ares uses a mainstream programming language (Ruby), and a plugin system to make coding easier, more flexible, and more pleasant.
