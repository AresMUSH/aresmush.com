AresMUSH features a fully-integrated **Web Portal** that allows you to interact with the game from a web browser.  Far from just a telnet window embedded in the browser, the web portal offers a rich experience and can fully replace (and enhance!) traditional game wikis.  Here are just a few of the features the web portal provides.

## Character Creation

Through the web portal, you can create your character with a few clicks of the mouse.

## Scene Logging

The game can automatically capture scene logs - stripped of OOC spam but including rolls and combat messages - and easily share them to the web portal.

## Game Wiki

The web portal includes a fully-featured wiki that offers many of the same [extensions](/help/1-0/website/markdown/) (like dynamic lists and tab views) as Wikidot and MediaWiki.  BSG:Unification was able to completely recreate its Wikidot wiki using the web portal wiki.

## Directory

With a direct integration to the game, the web portal lets you access the character profiles, mail, bulletin boards, the game census and more.  No more manually updating actor lists, or editing your wiki page just because your character got promoted.  The data is drawn directly from the game.

## Web Client

The web client lets you connect to the game and play via an embedded telnet window.  It's pretty bare-bones, but handy when you can't run a real client.

## Configuration

For game admins, the web portal allows you to configure and customize the game settings.  You can view logs, change the web portal styles, and more.
