# Configuring FS3 Combat - Miscellaneous

This topic describes some miscellaneous combat options you can configure.

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.
2. Select 'Advanced Configuration'.
3. Edit `config_fs3combat.yml` 

## Stances

You can configure what stances are available in combat and the attack/defense modifiers they convey.  

> **Important:** If you change/remove the names of any of the built-in stances, you'll want to check the code too.  Some of the stances have special effects (notably Cover and Hidden) in addition to the stance modifiers.
