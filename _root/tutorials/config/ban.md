# Configuring Banned and Suspect Sites

You can register certain IPs or hostnames as banned or suspect to block/alert you to problem players.  

To configure banned and suspect sites:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Ban/Suspect Sites'.

Add an IP address or host name to the list.  To enable the proxy site ban, check the "disable known proxies" box.  To learn more about how banned and suspect sites work and what other options you have, see the [Dealing with Trolls](/tutorials/manage/trolls) tutorial.
