# Configuring the Server

Your server host and port information are set up during installation.  If they ever change, you'll need to update the configuration.

For more info on server configuration options, see [Basic Configuration](/tutorials/install/basic-config).

To configure the server:

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Edit `server.yml`.
4. Shutdown and restart the game. (See the tutorials at [aresmush.com](http://www.aresmush.com) if you need help doing this.)

> **Important!** Server setting changes will not take effect until the game is restarted.
