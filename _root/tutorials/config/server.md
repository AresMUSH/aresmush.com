# Configuring the Server

Your server host and port information are set up during installation.  If they ever change, you'll need to update the configuration.

For more info on server configuration options, see [Installing the Game](/tutorials/install/install-game).

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Note:**  If you change the Engine API port and are using the API proxy feature, you will need to update your web server configuration.  See [Website Configuration](/tutorials/config/website) for details.

To configure the server:

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Edit `server.yml`.
4. Shutdown and restart the game. (See the tutorials at [aresmush.com](http://www.aresmush.com) if you need help doing this.)

> **Important!** Server setting changes will not take effect until the game is restarted.
