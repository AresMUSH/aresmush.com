# Configuring the Description System

To change the Description plugin configuration:

1. Select Admin -> Setup.
2. Edit `describe.yml`

## tag_colors

The system will display tags next to the names of new characters and admin.  You can configure which colors are used for these tags.  You'll probably want to make them match the colors used in the [Status System](/tutorials/config/status).
