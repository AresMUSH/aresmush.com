# Configuring Secret Codes

Passwords and other secret codes used by the game are stored in a special file so that you don't accidentally commit them to a public source control system if you're using 'git'.  

To configure the game secrets:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Secret Codes'.
