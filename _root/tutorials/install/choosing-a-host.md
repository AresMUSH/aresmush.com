A MUSH needs to be hosted on a server - in other words, installed on a computer in the cloud.  The easiest way to do this is to rent server space through a cloud hosting service.

I recommend [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=5c07173bc1f2).  It's what I use for [AresCentral](/arescentral).  

* If you would like Ares set up for you on Digital Ocean, see **[Digital Ocean Easy Mode](/tutorials/install/easy-mode)**.
* If you would like to install Ares on Digital Ocean yourself, see **[Digital Ocean Self-Install](/tutorials/install/digital-ocean)** for step-by-step instructions.
* If you prefer to find your own host, see the [System Requirements](/tutorials/install/system-requirements).   

If you don't like Digital Ocean, [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=80bc21df5f92ff5773de26419237b57a203623bd) is another solid option that works well with Ares, but I don't have detailed instructions for Linode.
