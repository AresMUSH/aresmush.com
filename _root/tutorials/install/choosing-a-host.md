A MUSH needs to be hosted on a server.  You have several options available.

## Cloud Hosting

Most MUs are hosted on a cloud server.  This is the easiest way to make your game accessible to the public.  It's more reliable and secure than trying to host it on your home network.  

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Note:** With a built-in web portal/wiki, a database and more advanced coding tools, Ares cannot run on the limited accounts provided by most dedicated "MUSH hosting" services.  You'll need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) where you have admin privileges.  I recommend [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=5c07173bc1f2).  It's what I use for [AresCentral](/arescentral).  

* If you would like Ares set up for you on Digital Ocean, see **[Digital Ocean Easy Mode](/tutorials/install/easy-mode)**.
* If you would like to install Ares on Digital Ocean yourself, see **[Digital Ocean Self-Install](/tutorials/install/digital-ocean)** for step-by-step instructions.
* If you prefer to find your own host, see the [System Requirements](/tutorials/install/system-requirements).  [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=80bc21df5f92ff5773de26419237b57a203623bd) is another solid option that works well with Ares.  The instructions are geared towards Digital Ocean, but you should be able to adapt them to Linode or other hosts without much trouble.

## Local Setup

If you want to set up Ares on your local computer for code development, see **[Setting up Ares On Your PC/Mac](/tutorials/code/local-setup)**.
