A MUSH needs to be hosted on a server - in other words, installed on a computer in the cloud.  The easiest way to do this is to rent server space through a cloud hosting service.

I recommend [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=5c07173bc1f2).  It's what I use for [AresCentral](/arescentral).  See **[Getting Started with Digital Ocean](/tutorials/install/digital-ocean)** for step-by-step instructions on setting up your game there.

If you prefer to find your own host, check out the [System Requirements](/tutorials/install/system-requirements).
