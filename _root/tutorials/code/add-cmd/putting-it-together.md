That's it!  Our plugin should be ready.  

## Try It Out

Let's give it a try.  Type `load custom` to load all the code we just wrote and then try out our commands:

* help goals
* help (to see goals listed under the Character Creation section)
* goals/set Some goals.
* goals
* goals SomeoneElse (try it with both an admin and non-admin and see the difference)
