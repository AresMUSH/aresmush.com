This is the second in the basic series of Ares coding tutorials.  The first one explored Ares code at a high level using the `ruby` and `tinker` commands to execute custom code snippets.   This one shows how to add your own command and help file.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll create a `goals` command that lets you record your character's goals.  Specific topics include:

* Editing server-side code.
* Editing help files.
* Adding database fields.
* Creating the goal command.

## What You'll Need

You'll need access to the game's code on the server, since this tutorial goes beyond simple tinkering.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
