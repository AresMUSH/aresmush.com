This is the third in the basic series of Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll create a `goals` command that lets you record your character's goals.  Specific topics include:

* Editing server-side code.
* Adding a help file.
* Adding database fields.
* Creating the goal command.

## What You'll Need

This tutorial is interactive, so you'll need the Headwiz character or [coder permissions](/tutorials/manage/roles) on an actual Ares game.  You'll also need access to the [server shell](/tutorials/manage/server-shell), as this tutorial goes beyond simple tinkering.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
