This is the second in the basic series of Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll create a `goals` command that lets you record your character's goals.  Specific topics include:

* Editing server-side code.
* Adding a help file.
* Adding database fields.
* Creating the goal command.

## What You'll Need

The tutorial is interactive, so it works best when you have coder privileges on an actual Ares game.  You can use the Headwiz character or assign the [coder role](/tutorials/manage/roles) to a character of your choice.  You'll also need access to the server-side code, as this tutorial goes beyond simple tinkering.

If you don't have privileges on an Ares game, you can always [install Ares locally](/tutorials/code/local-setup) so you have your own test game.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
