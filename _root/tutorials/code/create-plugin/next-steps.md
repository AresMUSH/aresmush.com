Congratulations! You've completed the Create a Plugin tutorial.

If you want to see what a more fully-developed Traits plugin could look like, including admin versions of the commands, there's one in the [Ares Extras repository](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-extras).

This is the final structured tutorial, but there are numerous [Advanced Coding Topics](/tutorials/code/) in the tutorials section.

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback). 

Happy coding!
