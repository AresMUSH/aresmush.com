This tutorial will show you how to create a brand new plugin.  Our example will be a Traits plugin - a simple way of setting descriptive stats as you might find on a comic game.

## What You'll Need

You'll need access to the game's code - either through the server shell or through a local copy of the code.  You can also [install Ares locally](/tutorials/code/local-setup) so you have your own test game.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

It may be helpful to review the options for [changing Ares code](/tutorials/code/overview) before you begin, since this tutorial goes beyond simple tinkering.

## Conventions

These tutorials assume that you're logged in with the game's master admin character (named Headwiz), but you can use any character with the `coder` role.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
