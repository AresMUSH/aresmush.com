This tutorial will introduce the moving parts that go into a Web Portal screen by examining the code behind the Events screen.

The Web Portal uses a completely different language (Javascript instead of Ruby) and framework (EmberJS) than the game engine/plugins/etc.  That's the bad news.

The good news is that most games won't need to modify the Portal code.  The  Portal offers core functionality that is going to be common across most - if not all - games.   The style is highly configurable without even needing to touch the code at all.

If you do need to change the Portal code - perhaps to add your own custom chargen for a system other than FS3 - this tutorial will introduce the Portal's basic building blocks.

## What You'll Need

Unlike the other two basic tutorials, this one doesn't require writing any code.  You don't need any special permissions or prerequisites.
