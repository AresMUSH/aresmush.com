Congratulations!  You've complete the Anatomy of a Portal Screen tutorial.

This was the final of the three basic tutorials introducing Ares code.

There are many more coding articles available on the [Code Tutorials](/tutorials/code) page, but don't try to read them all at once.  It'll be overwhelming.  Try to learn bits and pieces as you need them.  

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback). 

Happy coding!
