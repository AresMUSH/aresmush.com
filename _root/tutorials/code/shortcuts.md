AresMUSH provides shortcuts for commands. Shortcuts let you use shorter versions (ex for examine) as well as aliases for commands that might have alternate names (finger for profile, or outfit/remove for outfit/delete).

Usually you won't need to mess with the shortcuts, but if you are annoyed by something not being named the way you expect, you can add one.   You can add custom shortcuts to the `custom.yml` configuration file.  Here's an example of what shortcut config looks like:

        "chargen" : "cg"
        "cg/back": "cg/prev"
