This is the second in the series of basic Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

Although you can use the [tinker](/tutorials/code/tinker) command for quick code tasks, the bulk of Ares code lives on the server, like the news and connect files in Penn/Tiny.  To change the code, you'll need to edit these code files.  There are several ways you can do this.  This tutorial will show you how.

## What You'll Need

This is primarily an explanatory/video-based tutorial.  It's helpful (but not required) if you have coder privileges and server access on an actual Ares game so you can try out what you learn.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
