In all our examples so far, we've tested out our code changes on our real game.  This is convenient, but not ideal.  If we mess something up we'll be impacting our players.  In this section of the tutorial, we'll talk about how you can set up a second copy of the game for the express purpose of testing your code.

There is no transcript for this section, but you can get more details about some of the options in the [Development Tools](/tutorials/code/dev-tools) article.
