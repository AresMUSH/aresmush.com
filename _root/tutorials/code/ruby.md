There are a lot of Ruby tutorials out there, plus books on the subject. Here are a couple good ones:

* [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) - 15-minute interactive introduction to the basics.
* [Ruby Quickstart](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) - Another good short introduction.
* [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf) - Very tongue-in-cheek guide that dives into some journeyman topics.
* [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby) - Great multi-media tutorials.  The first level is free but subsequent levels require a paid subscription.  CodeSchool also has an Ember tutorial to help with the Web Portal code.
* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - The tutorials aren't as good as CodeSchool (IMHO) but it's free.
* Udemy also has a modestly priced Ruby tutorial, but I haven't tried it.

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Note:** Some tutorials will be about "Ruby on Rails". Rails is just a website development framework that uses Ruby. Learning Rails isn't necessarily bad - you'll find some similar concepts in Ares - but Ares uses EmberJS instead of Rails. It's safe to skip the Rails stuff.

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback).
