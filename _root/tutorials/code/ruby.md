There are a lot of Ruby tutorials out there, plus books on the subject. Here are a couple good ones:

* [Try Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/) - Short interactive introduction to the basics.
* [Ruby Quickstart](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) - Another good short introduction.
* [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf) - Very tongue-in-cheek guide that dives into some journeyman topics.
* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - More in-depth tutorials.
* Udemy and Plursalsight also have modestly-priced Ruby tutorials, but I haven't tried it.

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Note:** Some tutorials will be about "Ruby on Rails". Rails is just a website development framework that uses Ruby. Learning Rails isn't necessarily bad - you'll find some similar concepts in Ares - but Ares uses EmberJS instead of Rails. It's safe to skip the Rails stuff.

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback).
