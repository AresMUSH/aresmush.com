In order to show and edit character goals from the web portal, we'll need to actually have some data storage for those goals.  If you've still got the code from the Goals Command Tutorial in your game, you're all set.  Otherwise, you'll need to add a database field for the goals.  Follow the steps in [Creating a Database Field](/tutorials/code/add-cmd/db-field) and then come back here.
