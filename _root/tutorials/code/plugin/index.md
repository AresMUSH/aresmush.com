This tutorial will show you how to create a brand new plugin.

## What You'll Need

In this tutorial, you'll be creating a new plugin from scratch.  You'll need access to the game's source code - either through the server shell or through a local copy of the code.  You can also [install Ares locally](/tutorials/code/local-setup) so you have your own test game.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

## Conventions

These tutorials assume that you're logged in with the game's master admin character (named Headwiz), but you can use any character with the `coder` role.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
