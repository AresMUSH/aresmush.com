All configuration is done through the game's [Web Portal](/tutorials/web-portal).  Log in as an admin user and visit the Admin screen.

The most basic game settings have dedicated screens.  These are the things that virtually every game will need to adjust.

For more advanced configuration, you will need to edit the game's configuration files.  You can do this through the server shell or through the Web Portal by selecting `Advanced Configuration`.
