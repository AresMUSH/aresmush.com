The [Ares Extras repository](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-extras) in GitHub contains a hodgepodge of things that are not part of the main Ares release.  There are code snippets (like a sample import from Wikidot), community-authored plugins, and other tidbits.

Coders are welcome to fork this repository and submit GitHub Pull Requests for any contributions.  Some guidelines:

* Use clear names and comments where necessary so people reading the code can tell what's going on.
* Include a README.md file with instructions on what the code does, how you use it, what configuration options there are, etc.
* Don't smush everything into a giant file and/or class.  Split things up appropriately.
* [Localization](/tutorials/code/localization) is recomended.

Basically, if Faraday can't make heads or tails of your code, it won't make the cut.
