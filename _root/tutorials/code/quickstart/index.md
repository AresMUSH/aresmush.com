This tutorial will teach you the basics of Ares code.

## What We'll Cover

* Executing Ruby code using the `ruby` and `tinker` commands.
* Emitting messages.
* Parse command arguments.
* Updating fields in the database.
* A few other basic Ares coding concepts.

## What You'll Need

The tutorial is interactive, so it works best when you have coder privileges on an actual Ares game.  You can use the Headwiz character or assign the [coder role](/tutorials/manage/roles) to a character of your choice.  

If you don't have privileges on an Ares game, you can always [install Ares locally](/tutorials/code/local-setup) so you have your own test game.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
