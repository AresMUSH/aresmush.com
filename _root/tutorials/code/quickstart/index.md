This tutorial will take you through a series of exercises to teach you Ares code.

## What You'll Need

The tutorial is interactive, so it works best when you have [coder privileges](/tutorials/manage/roles) on an actual Ares game.  You can also [install Ares locally](/tutorials/code/local-setup) so you have your own test game.  If all else fails, the exercises still explain key concepts and contain useful reference code even if you can't get the satisfaction of running it.

## Conventions

These tutorials assume that you're logged in with the game's master admin character (named Headwiz), but you can use any character with the `coder` role.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback).
