This tutorial will teach you the basics of Ares code.

## What We'll Cover

* Executing Ruby code using the `ruby` and `tinker` commands.
* Emitting messages.
* Parsing command arguments.
* Updating fields in the database.
* A few other basic Ares coding concepts.

## What You'll Need

This tutorial is interactive, so you'll need the Headwiz character or [coder permissions](/tutorials/manage/roles) on an actual Ares game.  

> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Note:** It's strongly recommended that you follow the standard [installation instructions](/tutorials/install) for your very first Ares game.  For just a few bucks, less than the price of a grande coffee, you can spin up a droplet for a couple weeks and get your feet wet.  That way you're not trying to learn both Ares code and Ares server setup at the same time!  Once you have a little more experience with Ares, you can explore some of the [other options](/tutorials/code/dev-tools) for setting up a game for development purposes.
