The `tinker` command lets us execute arbitrary code snippets.  It's handy for quick one-off tasks that you don't want to create a whole command for.  That makes it ideal for trying out some code examples in our tutorial.

To change the tinker code:

1. Log into the Web Portal.
2. Go to Admin -> Tinker.
3. Edit the code as explained in each exercise.
4. Click Save.

Once you've changed the tinker code, you can log into the game with a MUSH client and type `tinker`.  You'll see the desired output.

> **Tip:** If you get an error when saving your code, check to make sure you've typed it exactly as indicated.  Usually errors result from misplaced braces `{}` or missing `end` statements.

There's a more in-depth [Tinkering Tutorial](/tutorials/code/tinker) if you want to learn more about tinkering when you've finished with the Quickstart.
