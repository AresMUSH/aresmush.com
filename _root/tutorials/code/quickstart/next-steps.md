Congratulations!  You've completed the AresMUSH Code Quickstart Tutorial.  

There are many more coding articles available on the [Code Tutorials](/tutorials/code) page, but don't try to read them all at once.  It'll be overwhelming.  Try to learn bits and pieces as you need them.  

You may also want to enhance your basic Ruby skills by checking out some of the [Ruby resources](/tutorials/code/ruby).

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback). 

Happy coding!
