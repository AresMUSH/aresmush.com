The Web Portal has a number of [configuration options](/tutorials/config/website) that let you customize how it looks - the images, the colors and styles, the organization of the character pages, and more. 

Beyond that, however, it's not designed to be as extensible and flexible as the rest of the Ares code.  You'll want to be pretty comfortable coding in Ares before you try to tackle extending the Web Portal code. 

There are some Web Portal tutorials and notes in the [Advanced Coding](/tutorials/code) section when you're ready.
