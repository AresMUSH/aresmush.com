AresMUSH is ready to go out of the box with a default configuration based on a Battlestar Galactica game.  Most games will want to customize Ares to their own theme and preferences.

You can view the configuration instructions through the online help, either through the game itself or here in the [Online Help Archive](/plugins).

# Configuing via the Web Portal

All configuration is done through the game's [Web Portal](/tutorials/web-portal).  

Log in as an admin user and visit the Admin screen.

# Basic Configuration

The most basic game configuration settings have dedicated pages on the admin screen.  These are the things that virtually every game will need to adjust.

For example, there is a screen to configure the FS3 Skills list:

# Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configuration, you will need to edit the game's configuration files.  This can also be done through the Web Portal by selecting `Advanced Configuration`.  

Through the Advanced Configuration screen, you can edit a variety of configuration settings.  See these tutorials for more information:

* [Configuration Files](/tutorials/code/configuration)
* [Templates](/tutorials/code/templates)
* [Locale Strings](/tutorials/code/locale)

For any kind of advanced configuration, you will be presented with a code editor that lets you change the settings.
