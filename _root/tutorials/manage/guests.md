The default Ares database includes several guest characters, Guest-1 through Guest-4, each with a default password of 'guest'.

You can rename these guests to whatever you like. The game looks for the 'guest' role, not specific names.

Four guests should be sufficient, but if you find yourself needing more, you can add new ones simply by assigning a character the 'guest' role. See [Roles tutorial](/tutorials/manage/roles) for more information.
