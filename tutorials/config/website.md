There are a variety of things you can configure about the Web Portal.

{% include toc.html %}

## Home Page Text

You can configure the welcome text on the Web Portal's home page.

1. Select Admin -> Setup -> Website
2. Select Home Page Text.

The home page text can contain [Markdown formatting](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and ansi formatting codes.

## Selecting a Theme

Ares comes with a default theme.  There are others available as [AresCentral Theme Directory](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/themes), including a dark one. You can install one of the other themes simply by using the in-game command `theme/install <github url>`. For example: `theme/install https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-dark-theme`
  
To restore the default theme, use `theme/install default`.

Once you've selected a theme (or if you keep the default one) you can customize it a great deal using the settings described below.

## Changing the Colors

To change the colors on the web portal:

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Select Edit Theme Colors.
3. Use the color widgets to select the desired colors.

You can alternately edit the colors.scss config file (via Admin -> Setup -> Text Files) and enter colors manually using [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).

Here are the available colors:

* Background color - The main page background.
* Text color - The main text color.
* Primary color - Headings and table headers.
* Primary outline color - Border around the primary headings.
* Primary words color - The words inside something that uses the primary color.
* Secondary color - Links and contrast colors.
* Gutter color - The gutter borders on the left and right side of the page.
* Border color - Boxes and lines around things.
* Faded text color - Hints and subtle headings, like the sidebar headings.

{% note %} 
After changing the colors, you'll usually need to do a force-refresh on your browser to make it reload the page.  This is a browser thing, not an Ares thing.
{% endnote %}

## Images

There are three main images used by the website.  

* background.png - Used as a background image across the page title/header area.
* box-bg.png - Used as a background behind the character profile and log pages.
* jumbotron.png - Home page image.
* favicon.ico and favicon-active.ico - The little icon that appears in a browser tab to identify the site.  There are a number of [free generators](https://favikon.com/) that can make one from your image of choice.  The 'active' version should either change colors or have a little indicator on it to indicate new activity.  If you need help doing that, feel free to [ask](/feedback.html).

You can upload new versions on the website.

1. Go to Directory -> Files.
2. Select the `theme_images` directory.
3. Select an image you wish to change.
4. Select "Upload Files".
5. Browse to find your new image on your PC.
6. Make sure that the file is named **exactly the same** as the original (e.g. background.png) and the "**Overwrite**" box is checked.
7. Click the upload button.

{% note %} 
Some browsers (notably Chrome) are stubborn about reloading theme images right away due to image caching.  Try viewing it in private/incognito mode to see your new images.
{% endnote %}

You can use [Custom CSS](#custom-css-style), explained below, to change which images are used in each section.  For example, if you want to use different backgrounds for the profile and log pages, or a JPG instead of a PNG for the title background.

### Choosing a Header Background

The default style positions the header background in a 200 pixel high area using `background-size: cover` and `background-position: center`.  

* **Cover** will either stretch or crop the image to make it cover the entire header area.  
* **Center** always tries to keep the center of the image in view.

Take the BSGU background image, for example.  Here is the original image.  Notice that the center of the image is near the Cylon's shoulder.

{% include pretty_image.html file='web-portal/background-main.jpg' %}

In wide browsers, you'll get a 200 pixel wide swath across the center of the image.  Notice that the Cylon's shoulder is still in the center of the header.

{% include pretty_image.html file='web-portal/background-wide.jpg' %}
{% include pretty_image.html file='web-portal/background-wide-example.jpg' %}

And in narrow browsers, including mobile, the height will be scaled down to be 200 pixels high, and the width will be cropped to fit.  Notice again that the Cylon's shoulder is still in the center of the header.

{% include pretty_image.html file='web-portal/background-narrow.jpg' %}

You can pick a different focal point (other than center) and scale the image in different ways, as explained in the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) tutorial on background positioning.  This can be done using [Custom CSS](#custom-css-style), explained below.

## Changing the Navbar

The `top_navbar` setting lets you customize your web portal's navigation bar. Note that the "Account" items (notifications, mail, etc.) will automatically move to the front of the navbar on small browsers.

Here's an example of the navbar config:

    - title: Home
      route: home
    - title: First Dropdown Menu Title
      menu:
         - route: some-ember-route
           title: First Page Title
         - route: another-ember-route
           title: "<i class='fas fa-info-circle" /> Second Page Title"
    - title: Second Dropdown Menu Title
      menu:
         - route: random-ember-route
           title: Third Page Title
         - divider: true
         - url: http://somewhere.com
           title: Some Outside Page Title

Some things to note:

* You can include HTML in the menu titles. Notably, this lets you use fontawesome icon codes in place of or alongside your menu text.
* Top-level nav items can be a dropdown menu (use the `menu` option to list the menu's pages) or a single page link (omit the `menu` option)

### Role-Restricted Menus

You can use the `roles` option to restrict a top nav menu to certain roles. Specify a list of role names. Even if there's only a single role, still specify it like a list. For example:

    - title: Admin
      roles: 
      - admin
      - coder
      menu:
      - title: Jobs
        route: jobs

{% note %}
This only works for the top menu items, and not individual pages within the submenu.
{% endnote %}

### Internal Pages

For an internal page, list the page **route** and display title.  For example:

    - title: Characters
      route: characters

{% note %} 
The route must match the **internal coded route name** used by the web portal.  This is often **not** the same as the URL you see in the browser. For example, the character gallery is http://somegame.com/chars but the route is named 'characters'. You can get a complete list of routes by going to http://YOUR_WEB_PORTAL/routes.  If the one you want isn't listed, just [ask for help](/feedback.html).
{% endnote %}

Some routes, notably help-topic and wiki-page, require you to specify a model identifier matching the help topic name or wiki page name.  For example:

    - title: Getting Started
      route: wiki-page
      id: getting_started
      
A few routes, notably the theme config files, require multiple model IDs. For these, use the `ids` parameter. For example:

    - title: Custom Styles
      route: textfile
      ids:
        - style
        - custom_style.scss

### External URLs

You can also link to an external URL outside the web portal.  List the URL, a display title, and an *optional* [browser tab target](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp).  For example:

    - target: blank
      title: Interactive Combat Walkthrough <i class="fa fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true">
      url: http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat-walkthrough

### Dividers

For a dividing line, just use:

    - divider: true
    
This only makes sense inside a dropdown menu.

## Configuring Recaptca

You can use Google's [Recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/) to keep bots from creating accounts.  This is optional, but if you don't turn it on you should disable `allow_web_registration`.  Otherwise you'll get bot accounts for sure.

Sign up for your own Recaptcha key by clicking "Get Recaptcha" from the [Recaptcha site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).

1. Create a new "Recaptcha v2" key.
2. List your game's website domain under the domains list.  You can also list 'localhost' if you're doing local testing.
3. Google will show your key info.

Under 'Client Side Integration' you'll find a code snippet like this:

`<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="ABCD123"></div>`

The 'ABCD123" is your Recaptcha Site.

Under 'Server Side Integraton' you'll see an entry like this:

`secret(required): DEFGH789`

The 'DEFGH789 is your Recaptcha Secret.

To configure the recaptcha information:

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Edit `secrets.yml`.

Enter the Recaptcha Site and Secret you got from the code snippet above.

## Custom CSS Style

Beyond the colors, you can add custom CSS styles that will override the Web Portal style to your heart's content. The Web Portal uses SCSS, which is an enhanced version of CSS that lets you use variables and advanced style settings.

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Edit `custom_style.scss`.

{% note %} 
After changing the custom CSS style, you'll usually need to do a force-refresh on your browser to make it reload the page.  This is a browser thing, not an Ares thing.
{% endnote %}

### Changing the Font

Many games want to change the text font.  You can easily use a Google font by adding the following to your custom CSS style:

    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto');
    body {    
      font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }    

### Icons

[FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icons are used throughout the site and available for your use in custom HTML.

## Wiki Options

See [Configuring the Wiki](/tutorials/config/wiki.html).

## HTTPS Web Portal

It is highly recommended that you set up your web portal with a security certificate so players can connect using HTTPS for security. This is typically done during the install process, but can be added at any time.  See [HTTPS Web Portal Setup](/tutorials/install/https.html).

## Advanced Options

The Web Portal has a number of configuration options.  To set them:

1. Select Admin -> Setup
2. Edit `website.yml`.

### allow_html_in_markdown

Many of the Web Portal pages allow players to enter [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  By default, Ares allows HTML in its Markdown text.  This gives players a great deal of flexibility for embedding images, youtube videos, or custom styles.  However, it *could* be used to run malicious or annoying javascript code.  If you run into trouble, you can tell Ares to run Markdown in safe mode by disabling HTML.

### max_upload_size_kb and max_folder_size_kb

You can configure the maximum sizes for an individual file upload, and an entire character's folder.  By default these are 300kb (per file) and 2000 kb (for the entire folder).  Wiki admins are not subject to these restrictions.

### website_code_path

By default, Ares assumes that the website will be installed in your home folder in a folder named 'ares-webportal'.  You can change this option if you've installed it in a different location.

### character_gallery_group and character_gallery_subgroup

By default, the character gallery page shows characters organized into tabs by Faction and then into sub-groups by Position.  You can change this by editing the two character gallery settings to be any two groups.  For example, on BSG:U the gallery was organized by Department then Position.

The main group is required, but you can set subgroup to an empty string (`""`) if you don't want to sub-sort.

### left_sidebar

If set to true, the sidebar appears on the left instead of the default right.

### hide_searchbox

Some games like to put search options into the menu, so you can use this setting to hide the default search box from the sidebar.

### auto_wiki_export and wiki_export_cron

The game automatically creates a downloadable export of the wiki and web portal scenes/characters/etc. for players to access offline. If you want to disable this, set the auto export to false.  You can also control what time the export happens.  (Just don't schedule it at the same time as your usual backup, as this may cause undue strain on the system.)
