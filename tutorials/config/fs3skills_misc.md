To configure the FS3 Skills List:

1. Select Admin -> Setup.
2. Edit `fs3skills.yml`

## roll_channel

FS3 can optionally output rolls to a channel in addition to the room where the roll is made.  This can help staff call for rolls from afar.  Remove this entry if you don't want to use a rolls channel.

## max_luck

You can configure the maximum number of Luck Points a character can save up at any one time.

## public_sheets

By default, players can view each others' sheets.  You can disable that by changing this setting to false.
