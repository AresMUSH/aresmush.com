### Basic FS3 Config

These are the basic configuration options that most games will need to tweak for their theme/setting.

* [Configuring FS3 Combat Miscellaneous](/tutorials/config/fs3combat_misc.html)
* [Configuring FS3 Combat Skills](/tutorials/config/fs3combat_skills.html)

### FS3 Gear Config

The default gear lists are designed for a Battlestar setting.  If you're using another setting, you'll probably need to tweak the gear lists.  If you have custom vehicles or unusual combatant types (like six-legged aliens.html), you'll need to adjust the hit location tables.
