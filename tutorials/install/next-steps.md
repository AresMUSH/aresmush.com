Congratulations! Your AresMUSH game should now be up and running.

Try connecting to the game with your favorite MUSH client. Use the same hostname and port number you used in the server info configuration (e.g. mygame.somehost.com 4201).  Open the Web Portal in your browser (e.g. http://mygame.somehost.com). 

> If you can't connect, see the [troubleshooting tutorials](/tutorials/code) for help.  If you're stuck, you can [Ask for Help](/feedback.html) in a variety of ways.

## Default Characters

Ares comes with a "headwiz" character, akin to the "God" character on Penn and Tiny. 

    Username: Headwiz
    Password: change_me!

There's also a "builder" character:

    Username: Builder
    Password: change_me!

You can rename them if you like.  

{% note %}
Be sure to log them in and change their passwords (`password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>`) immediately!
{% endnote %}

## Getting Started as an Admin

Ares works out of the box, but there are a lot of things you can configure to make the game your own.  You can even alter the code to add custom functionality.  A rich suite of [tutorials](/tutorials) are available to help you on your way.  

Two to start with are:

* [Getting Started as an Admin](/tutorials/manage/started.html) - general help setting up your own admin character and doing basic administrative tasks.
* [Essential Configuration](/tutorials/config/config-basics) - customizing your game's settings.
