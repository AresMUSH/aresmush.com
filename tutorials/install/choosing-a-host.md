MUSHes need to be hosted on a cloud server to make the game accessible to the public.

With a built-in web portal/wiki, a database and more advanced coding tools, Ares cannot run on the limited accounts provided by most dedicated "MUSH hosting" services.  You'll need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) where you have admin privileges. I recommend [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=5c07173bc1f2).  It's what I use for [AresCentral](/arescentral.html) and what the automated installer is designed for.
