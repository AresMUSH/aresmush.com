[AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com) has an automatic game directory that lists all active Ares games.  You can control how your game shows up there.

## Game Info

The general information shown in the directory comes from your [Game Directory Config](/tutorials/config/game_dir.html).

## Registration

It is presumed that most games 'In Development' aren't ready to be listed on the directory yet.  Your game will register itself with AresCentral whenever you set the **Public Game** flag in your info to true.

You *can* register a private game, but you must do so manually.  With an admin character, type `game/register` in-game.

{% include note.html content="You cannot link character to player handles until your game is registered.  This is a big reason why you might want to register a private game." %}

## Status

Your game will check in with AresCentral daily to update its status, including information for the game's activity tracker.
