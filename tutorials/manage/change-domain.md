title: Changing the Domain Name
description: 
layout: page
---

When your game is first set up, you choose a domain name, like `yourgame.aresmush.com`.  It's kind of a pain to change this after the game is installed, but it can be done.  

{% note %}
These instructions assume some technical know-how to edit files on the server shell.  Don't hesitate to [ask for help](/feedback.html) if you run into trouble.
{% endnote %}

* Update your domain host to point the new domain name to the game server.  If you've got an aresmush.com domain, [contact Faraday](/feedback.html).  
    * If your game already has players, you probably want to leave the old hostname also still pointing to the server. 
* Ensure that the new domain is visible to the server.  From the server shell, type `nslookup yourgame.somewhere.com`.
    * If the domain is visible, it will show a "non-authoritative answer" with your IP address.
    * It may take up to 24 hours after changing domain information before the server can see the new domain.
* **DO NOT PROCEED** until the new domain is visible to the server.
* In the web portal, go to Admin->Setup and edit server.yml.  Set `hostname` to the new domain.
* [Shut down](/tutorials/manage/shutdown.html) the game engine.
* Edit the nginx configuration file and replace all instances of your old host with the new host name.  
    * You can edit this using `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`.
    * If you've installed the security certificate, also remove the lines that say "managed by certbot".
    * If you have players who might connect to the old address, you can put both addresses under the `server_name`.  For example: `server_name  example.org  www.example.org;`
* Restart the nginx web server using `sudo service nginx restart`.
* If you had a security certificate installed:
    * Use `sudo certbot delete` to delete the current HTTPS certificate.
    * Redo the [HTTPS security certificate installation](/tutorials/config/server.html#https-web-portal).
* Reboot the server.  When it comes back up, you should be good to go with your new host name.
