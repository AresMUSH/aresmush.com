All games come to an end eventually, and when that happens you don't want to lose your entire website.  

## Creating a Portal Archive

Ares allows you to export the key bits of the web portal to disk:  Characters, Scenes and Wiki.  

See 'help wiki export' in your in-game help files for details.

If you do have your archive available publicly, you may [contact Faraday](/feedback.html) to have it linked to the [AresCentral game archive](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/wiki).

(For older games, run `bundle exec rake webexport` from the server shell's aresmush directory, and the output will be in the wiki-export folder.)

## Archiving Wiki Markdown

You can also export just the raw markdown files for the wiki itself:

    bin/script export_wiki_markdown

The files will be in the wiki-md directory, which you can then FTP to your PC.
