All games come to an end eventually, and when that happens you don't want to lose your entire website.  Ares allows you to export the key bits of the web portal to disk:  Characters, Scenes and Wiki.  

See 'help wiki export' in your in-game help files for details.

If you do have your archive available publicly, [contact Faraday](/feedback.html) to have it linked to the [AresCentral game archive](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/wiki).
