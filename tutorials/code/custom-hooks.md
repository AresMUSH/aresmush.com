Normally, modifying the base Ares code exposes you to *merge conflicts*.  This is an annoying process that forces you to reconcile your changes with the base code changes whenever you upgrade.

There are, however, several places that are designed with **custom code hooks**, which let you hook in custom code without actually touching the core code.

{% include toc.html %}

{% include custom_hooks.md %}
