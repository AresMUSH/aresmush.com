This tutorial will teach you the basics of Ares code.

## What We'll Cover

* Executing Ruby code using the `ruby` and `tinker` commands.
* Emitting messages.
* Parsing command arguments.
* Updating fields in the database.
* A few other basic Ares coding concepts.

## What You'll Need

This tutorial is interactive, so you'll need the Headwiz character or [coder permissions](/tutorials/manage/roles.html) on an actual Ares game.  

## Don't Have a Game?

It's strongly recommended that you follow the standard [installation instructions](/tutorials/install) for your very first Ares game.  This way you're not trying to learn both Ares code and Ares server setup at the same time!  

Using the Digital Ocean [referral bonus](/tutorials/install/digital-ocean.html), you'll get a month or two for free - long enough to play around with the game and get your feet wet.  Faraday can even [set it up for you](/tutorials/install/easy-mode.html).  After that, the prices are reasonable.  Less than the price of a grande coffee each month.

If that's not a viable option for you, there are instructions for how to set up an Ares test game on your [local PC or Mac](/tutorials/code/dev-tools.html) for development purposes.
