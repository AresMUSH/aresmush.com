The main Ares game code is written in Ruby.  If you're not already familiar with the language, the [Try Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/) interactive tutorial will give you a quick overview of the basics in under half an hour.

The Try Ruby tutorial should be enough to get you through the Quickstart and doing some basic Ares coding.  There are a variety of [Ruby resources](/tutorials/code/ruby.html) out on the web if you ever want to learn more.
