This is the fifth in the basic series of Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll add character goals to the web portal.

## What You'll Need

This tutorial is interactive, so you'll need the Headwiz character or [coder permissions](/tutorials/manage/roles.html) on an actual Ares game.  You'll also need access to the [server shell](/tutorials/install/server-shell.html), as this tutorial goes beyond simple tinkering.

## Getting Help

If at any point you run into trouble, you can [Get Help](/feedback.html).
