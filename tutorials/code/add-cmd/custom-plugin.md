All commands need to live inside of a plugin.  It would be overkill to create a whole plugin just for one or two commands.  That's where the [Custom](/tutorials/code/custom.html) plugin comes in.  The custom plugin is just a special place set aside for you to add your own custom commands, like this one.  The code for the custom plugin lives in the `aresmush/plugins/custom` directory.

## Try It

Find the custom plugin directory.
