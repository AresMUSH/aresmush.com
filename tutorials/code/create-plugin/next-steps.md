Congratulations! You've completed the Create a Plugin tutorial.

If you want to see the complete Cortex plugin code, you can find it in the [Ares Extras repository](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-extras).

This was the fourth of the structured tutorials introducing Ares code.  The next is [Modifying the Web Portal](/tutorials/code/add-web).

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback.html). 

Happy coding!
