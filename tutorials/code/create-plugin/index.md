This is the fourth in the series of basic Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll examine the design of the Cortex plugin, a simplified implementation of the [Cortex Classic RPG System](https://boardgamegeek.com/rpgsystem/2044/cortex-classic) used in the Firefly and Leverage RPGs.

You can find the full code for the Cortex plugin in [GitHub](https://github.com/aresmush/ares-cortex-plugin).

{% note %} 
You don't need to do this tutorial if all you want to do is **use** the Cortex plugin.  Instead, follow the instructions in [Community Contributions](/tutorials/code/contribs.html) to install the plugin.  This article is for coders who want to understand how the plugin was created.

## What You'll Need

Unlike the other two, this is not a "Try It!" tutorial.  It's more of a walk-through showing you how the Cortex plugin was built.
