This is the fourth in the series of basic Ares coding tutorials.

## What We'll Cover

In this tutorial, we'll examine the design of the Cortex plugin, a simplified implementation of the [Cortex System](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/58488/Cortex-Classic-System-Role-Playing-Game) used in the Firefly and Leverage RPGs.

You can find the full code for the Cortex plugin in the [Ares Extras](/tutorials/code/extras.html) repository.

{% include note.html content="You don't need to do this tutorial if all you want to do is **use** the Cortex plugin.  Instead, follow the instructions in [Ares Extras](/tutorials/code/extras.html) to install the plugin.  This article is for coders who want to understand how the plugin was created." %}

## What You'll Need

Unlike the other two, this is not a "Try It!" tutorial.  It's more of a walk-through showing you how the Cortex plugin was built.  

## Getting Help
