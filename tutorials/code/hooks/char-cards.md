> This [custom code hook](/tutorials/code/custom-hooks.html) is part of the Scenes plugin.

Character cards are mini-profiles that are shown when you click on a character's icon next to their pose.  You can design your own custom character cards with custom code.  There are three steps to this:

## Enable Custom Cards

First you need to enable custom cards by setting `use_custom_char_cards` to `true` in the [scenes configuration](/tutorials/config/scenes.html)

## Create Your Template

Initially, your custom card will be blank.  To make it show something, you'll need to put some code into  `ares-webportal/app/templates/components/char-card-custom.hbs`.

You'll probably want to start by copying the code from the [standard template](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-webportal/blob/master/app/templates/components/char-card.hbs) and pasting it into your custom card file.  You can then tweak it, add new styling, or completely change the look and feel.

There are a number of character fields available for use in the template.  You use them like `char.name` or `char.description`.


| Field | Description |
|----|----|
| `name` | Character name. |
| `demographics` | A list of all demographics, each with `name` and `value` properties. |
| `groups` | A list of group affiliations and rank, each with `name` and `value` properties. |
| `all_fields` |  Contain group, demographic, and rank data in a form where you can easily look up specific values, like `char.all_fields.faction` or `char.all_fields.height`. |
| `description` | Current description. |
| `status_message` | Special status, like NPC. |
| `is_ooc` | If the character is an OOC bit, like a staffer or playerbit. |
| `icon` | Icon data. |
| `custom` | Any custom fields you define, as explained in the next section. |

## Add New Data

If you want to show data that isn't already available, you'll have to add it in the custom fields section.  To do this, implement custom fields in the `custom_char_card_fields` method of `aresmush/plugins/scenes/custom_char_card.rb`

For example, if you wanted to show RP Hooks you could do:


    def self.custom_char_card_fields(char, viewer)
      {
         hooks: Website.format_markdown_for_html(char.rp_hooks)
      }
    end

You'll want to use the markdown formatter for freeform text that might include ansi or markdown codes.

Once you've made the data available, use it in your web template like so:

<pre>
    &#x7b;&#x7b;char.custom.hooks}}
</pre>
