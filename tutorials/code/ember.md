EmberJS is the Javascript web application framework, used in the Ares Web Portal.  Here are some resources to help you learn Ember.

* [Ember Guides](https://www.emberjs.com/learn/) - Ember's website has some excellent tutorials.
* [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby) - Great multi-media tutorials.  The first level is free but subsequent levels require a paid subscription.  CodeSchool also has a Ruby tutorial to help with the game engine code.
* [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/a-step-by-step-guide-to-building-your-first-ember-js-app) - Another good Ember tutorial.
* Udemy also has a modestly priced Ember tutorial, but I haven't tried it.

Don't forget you can always [ask for help](/feedback.html).
