Most commands will need to read data from or save data to the database.  Ares uses an off-the-shelf database tool called Redis.  The [Ohm](http://ohm.keyvalue.org/) database library lets you interact with the database directly from Ruby code.

{% include toc.html %}

## Models

Ohm lets you define ruby classes that interact with the database.  These are called **Models**, and you can identify them by the fact that they inherit from `Ohm::Model`.  Model classes define attributes that correspond to fields in the database.  For example, the `Character` class defines a name and alias: 

    class Character < Ohm::Model
      attribute :name
      attribute :alias
      ...
    end

You've probably seen database fields used throughout the code, in examples like `client.emit "Hello #{enactor.name}!"`   In that case, `enactor` is a character model, and `name` is the database field.

You'll need to look in the code to find out what database fields are available.

### Custom Models

To create a custom database model, you just need to define a class that inherits from `Ohm::Model`.

{% note %}
All database models should live in the base AresMUSH module, not in individual plugins.
{% endnote %}

**CORRECT**

    module AresMUSH
      class MyThing < Ohm::Model
      end
    end

**INCORRECT**

    module AresMUSH
      module SomePlugin
        class MyThing < Ohm::Model
        end
      end
    end

Once you have your model class, you can set up your own attributes. For example:


    module AresMUSH
      class MyThing < Ohm::Model
        attribute :name
        attribute :some_field
      end
    end

### Game Model

The Game model is special because there's only one game. You don't really need to search for it. You can access the one and only game model using:

    Game.master

## Instances

The model class defines the data for _all_ objects of that type. For example, the `Character` model class defines the data for all characters and `MailMessage` defines the data for all mail messages.

An **instance** is a specific occurrence of that model--a specific character, or a specific mail message.

You can create an instance of a model using `ClassName.create`, and optionally pass attribute/field data. For example:

    char = Character.create(name: "Jack")

The variable `char` now refers to your new database object instance, so you can use that instance to read and update fields, as described in the next section.

Deleting an object is as simple as:

    char.delete

{% note %}
Deleting an object can't be undone - there is no "trash can" in Ares. Use caution.
{% endnote %}

Read on for more information about finding and updating objects.

### Instance IDs

All Ohm models have an implicit `id` field that identifies a specific instance. This is just an auto-incrementing integer.

    char = Character.find_one_by_name("Bob")
    client.emit "Their ID is #{char.id}!"
    
Unlike in older MUSH codebases, IDs are **per model type**. Character 9 is a completely different object than Room 9.

## Fields

Once you have a database object instance, you can use its properties (aka **fields** or **attributes**) as simple methods.  

Fields are defined using the `attribute` keyword on the model class. For example, the Character class has a `name` field:

    class Character < Ohm::Model
      attribute :name
      ...
    end

### Getting Field Data

You can read properties just by using the attribute name like a method. For example:

    char = Character.find_one_by_name("Bob")
    client.emit "Hello #{char.name}!"

### Updating Fields

You can update the properties on a database object instance using the `update` method.  For example:

    char = Character.find_one_by_name("Bob")
    char.update(name: "Harry")

Many database properties have specialized update methods because their data storage is not so straightforward.  Look around for helper methods in the plugin module:

    char = Character.find_one_by_name("Bob")
    Demographics.set_group(char, "Faction", "Navy")

{% note %} 
Do not attempt to change database properties directly (e.g. `char.name = "Harry"`)  This changes the property on the ruby object <b>in memory</b> but does not actually update the database unless you call `char.save` at the end to commit the changes to the database.
{% endnote %}

### Field Types

Under the hood, all redis fields are stored as strings. The Ohm database library provides some utilities to let you tell the Ruby code to _interpret_ certain fields as different data types, as shown below:

    attribute :team, :type => DataType::Integer
    attribute :freshly_damaged, :type => DataType::Boolean
    attribute :armor_specials, :type => DataType::Array, :default => []
    attribute :prior_ammo, :type => DataType::Hash, :default => {}
    attribute :starts, :type => DataType::Time
    attribute :birthdate, :type => DataType::Date    

{% note %}
You may want to define default values for fields using other data types, especially hashes and arrays (which would otherwise be nil).
{% endnote %}


## Queries

The [Ohm](http://ohm.keyvalue.org/) database library provides a variety of ways to query for database models, but here are a few of the easiest:

* `Character[id]` - Finds an object directly by ID.
* `Character.find_one_by_name(name)` - Finds the first character with that name/alias.
* `Character.find_any_by_name(name)` - Finds *all* characters with that name/alias.
* `Character.all` - Finds *all* characters.

If your database isn't gigantic, you can also use the Ruby `select` statement to filter objects based on any set of criteria.  If your database is huge, you're better off using [Ohm's](http://ohm.keyvalue.org/) queries.  They're a little more complex, but faster.  Here's an example that will find all characters with the 'admin' role:


    def handle
      chars = Character.all.select { |c| c.has_any_role?("admin") }
      names = chars.map { |c| c.name }
      client.emit "You found #{names.join(", ")}"
    end

{% tip %} 
It is common to use  `select`  and  `map`  together like this.  Select will find a bunch of database objects, and map will get just the field you need from them (in this case the name).
{% endtip %}

### Finder Helpers

There are a few convenient utilities to help with common searches.  All of these will search by name or (for players) by alias, and include the `me` or `here` keywords, so they require you to pass in the character doing the search.

* `ClassTargetFinder` - Searches for a single object of the specified type.
* `AnyTargetFinder` - Searches for a single object among rooms, characters or exits.  Helpful for commands like describe/destroy that can work on multiple object types.
* `OnlineCharFinder` - Searches for a single matching online character.
* `VisibleTargetFinder` - Searches for a matching object in the same room - either a character, room or exit.  

All of the finder helpers do the error handling necessary to translate multiple matches into a message like "I don't know which one you mean" and no matches into "I don't see that here".  They return a `FindResult` object containing a 'found' indication and **either** the target object **or** an error message.

    result = ClassTargetFinder.find(name, Character, searcher)
    if (result.found?)
        # Object was found - do something with result.target
    else
       # Object was not found - do something with result.error
    end

### Target Finder Block helpers

Several of the more commonly-used target finders have another level of helper utility you can use.  Here's how it works:

    ClassTargetFinder.with_a_character(name, client, enactor) do |model|
        # Do something with model if it's found
    end

`with_a_character` will do the stuff in-between the `do` and the `end` if the character was found, using the variable `model` for the character it found. If the character was not found, it will emit the appropriate error message to the client.

There's a similar helpers for `with_something_visible` and `with_online_chars`.

{% tip %}
These versions are generally superior to the basic helpers because they take care of the error messages for you.
{% endtip %}

## Callback Methods

Some database models use **Callbacks** - methods that are triggered in response to certain database events.  There are two possible callbacks in Ares, called before an object is deleted or before it's saved:

* `before_delete` -  If an object has any references, you may want to delete them before the object itself is deleted.  For example, a room might delete all of its exits when it's getting deleted.
* `before_save` - If an object has special fields, you may set them before the object is saved.  For example, if you store the uppercase version of the object name for fast lookups, you want to update that to match the object name every time the object is saved.

## Relationships - References, Sets and Collections

Although Redis is not a relational database like SQL, we still need to define _relationships_ between our objects. A mail message has an author and recipients (all characters), a scene is attached to a room, etc.  Ohm provides some built in concepts that let us manage these relationships.  See [Database Relationships](/tutorials/code/db-relationships.html).
