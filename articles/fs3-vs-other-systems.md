In order to help people who may be familiar with other RPG systems, I have done a little comparison between some of the more popular systems and FS3 to show how the dice work.  This research was inspired by a [nice article comparing D20 and 3D6](http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue8/bitaboutd201.html).

## Background

The systems used in this article are D20, new World of Darkness (nWoD), FUDGE and FS3.  In my examples, I've used four people and the Firearms skill.  I assigned them skill ratings based on the *descriptions* of the ratings in each system's player's guide.  In all cases, I assumed average attributes.

* **Nate the Newbie** - Nate has just started out and he's still got a lot to learn.  He's probably taken a basic firearms course or gone to the range a few times.
* **Pete the Professional** - Pete is a professional soldier who is thoroughly competent with his rifle.
* **Victor the Veteran** - Vic is a highly skilled marksman.
* **Maria the Master** - Maria is an amazing marksman, an elite sniper or a world-class Olympic shooting competitor.

For each of these people, I modeled their success chance with different systems against Easy, Routine and Hard tasks.  Again, I used the *descriptions* of the difficulties from the player/GM guides.

* **Easy** -  Target shooting on the firing range.
* **Routine** - Firing a gun in combat at close range.
* **Hard** - Shooting a target under adverse conditions - wind or long range.

> You can find the details about the difficult ratings and skill levels used at the end of the article.

## Results

As you can see from the results below, there is huge difference in success chance in different systems.  There are two conclusions here I feel are important:

* You can't always go by the descriptions in the rulebook.  One system may say that a "good professional" succeeds 86% of the time, while another has it at 59%.
* FS3 gives the best chance of success in most cases compared to other systems because it is weighted intentionally to let people succeed more often.

###  Routine Task 

| Person | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE |  FS3 (2nd Ed) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nate the Newbie | 60% | 65% | 17% |  57% |
| Pete the Professional | 75% | 83% | 59% |86% |
| Victor the Veteran | 95% | 88% | 78% |  94% |
| Maria the Master | 95% | 91% | 90% |  98% |

###  Easy Task 

| Person | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE |  FS3 (2nd Ed) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nate the Newbie | 85% | 75% | 59% |  82% |
| Pete the Professional | 95% | 88% | 90% |  94% |
| Victor the Veteran | 95% | 91% | 99% | 98% |
| Maria the Master | 95% | 94% | 99% |  99% |

###  Hard Task 

| Person | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE |  FS3 (2nd Ed) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nate the Newbie | 10% | 30% | 1% |  25% |
| Pete the Professional | 25% | 75% | 17% |  67% |
| Victor the Veteran | 45% | 83% | 36% | 86% |
| Maria the Master | 70% | 88% | 59% |  94% |


## Appendix - Roll Details

### Skill Levels

Here are the levels used for the different rolls.  We could debate whether these ratings are truly equivalent but remember - they were selected based solely on the skill level descriptions.  Average attributes were used in all cases.

| Person | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE | FS3 (2nd Ed) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nate the Newbie | skill 1 (dex 11) | firearms 1 + dex 2 | Mediocre (-1) | Rookie - 1 (reactive 2) |
| Pete the Professional | skill 4 (dex 11) | firearms 3 + dex 2 | Good  (+1)  |  Professional - 5 (reactive 2) |
| Victor the Veteran | skill 8 (dex 11) | firearms 4 + dex 2 | Great (+2)  | Veteran - 8 (reactive 2) |
| Maria the Master | skill 13 (dex 11) | firearms 5 + dex 2 | Superb (+3)  |  Expert - 11 (reactive 2) |

> For example: Pete's skills were chosen to be "Competent" in nWoD, "Good" in FUDGE and "Professional" in FS3 -- all of which sound very apt for a pro.  D20 is a bit tougher, and chosen mostly based on my experience with D20 games.  You max out at 4 the skills you want to be pretty decent at.

### Difficulty Levels

Once again it was necessary to define these tasks consistently across the different skill systems.  I used their difficulty descriptions to figure out the numbers.  Here are the details:

| Difficulty Level | D20 | nWoD | FUDGE | FS3 (2nd Ed) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Easy | DC 5 | +1 dice pool | +2 to skill | +3 to skill |
| Routine | DC 10 | +0 dice pool | +0 to skill | +0 to skill |
| Hard | DC 20 | -2 dice pool | -2 to skill | -3 to skill |

> For example:  D20 and FS3 call out difficulty ratings explicitly.  FUDGE gives a hard task as needing "Great" success, which is 2 higher than normal... so that's equivalent to a -2 to the skill.  nWoD doesn't really give specifics about difficulty, so the die pool modifiers are rough estimates.
