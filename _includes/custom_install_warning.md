The automated install scripts are **only** designed work on the supported environment, which is a [stand-alone DigitalOcean droplet](/tutorials/install/digital-ocean.html).  If you are using any other environment, **do not** just blindly run the installers.  They may not work, and may even adversely affect your system.  Tailor the installation as needed for your environment, using the install scripts as a guide.
