> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have basic common knowledge (equivalent to the Everyman rating) in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.

## Language Skills

The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.

## Experience

Every week you get 1 XP.

You may only save up to 2 XP.  Remember you spend XP as you get it, resulting in a slow progression toward the next rating.  You don't save up a bunch to spend all at once.
