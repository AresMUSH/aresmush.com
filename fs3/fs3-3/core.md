Every game will configure FS3 differently, so you should consult your specific game policies for details.  

**FS3 Core** is the game configuration that comes with the default FS3 installation.  It is intended for near-future sci-fi combat games, such as Battlestar Galactica.  It is provided here as an example of how FS3 can be set up.

If you are a game designer looking to adapt FS3 Core to your own setting, see [Tweaking FS3](/fs3/fs3-3/tweaking-fs3.html).

> <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Tip:** You are assumed to have basic common knowledge (equivalent to the Everyman rating) in any Background Skill not listed on your character sheet. So even if you don't take the "football" skill, you've still probably played it a few times in gym class in school, watched it on TV, etc.

You must take **at least 1** Background Skill.  You can have up to **6 rating points** of Background Skills for free. 

## Language Skills

The specific list of Languages will vary from game to game.

## Experience

Every week you get 1 XP.

You may only save up to 2 XP.  Remember you spend XP as you get it, resulting in a slow progression toward the next rating.  You don't save up a bunch to spend all at once.
