---

FS3 is inherently a cooperative system, and players are encouraged to just work things out amongst themselves, using skill rolls as needed to guide them.  But sometimes even the best-intentioned players reach a stalemate.  This social combat system helps to resolve social conflict: when one character wishes to con, persuade, or manipulate another against their will.

In this system, the “attacker” is the character who wants to get someone else to do something.  The “defender” is the target of their efforts.

Social manipulation is all about leverage.  Attackers use leverage to get the target to do what they want.  Defenders use leverage to resist.  

The general flow to resolving social conflicts is:

1. The attacker OOCly declares their intention to enter social combat and makes a pose setting up their action.
2. If the defender wants to resist, the attacker and defender discuss what leverage applies in that situation and make the necessary rolls to determine who wins the contest.  This is described in detail described below.
3. Based on the winner, the defender poses their response.

{% note %} 
If at any point during this process, the players cannot reach an agreement on what leverage or resolution is reasonable, a staff member may be called in to help arbitrate.

Here’s an example of how this would work:

> Andrew draws himself up to his full height, fixing Ben with a glare.  “You better sit down before **I** sit you down, kid.”
>
> &lt;OOC&gt; Andrew says, “He’s using his intimidation to try to get Ben to back down.”
>
> &lt;OOC&gt; Ben says,  “OK let’s roll.  Here’s what leverages I think would apply…”
>
> Discussion is had and rolls are made.  Andrew wins.
>
> For a minute there, Ben looks like he’s about to throw down.  But slowly, gritting his teeth reluctantly, he takes his seat.

## What Does Winning Mean?

**Social combat is not mind control.**  Even if an attacker wins a social contest, that doesn’t mean they get to script the defender’s response.  The defender must respect the roll, but they get to choose the reaction that’s most appropriate to their character.

For example, in the Ben/Andrew example above, sitting down was what Andrew asked for, but there could have been other valid responses to a successful Intimidation roll.  For example:

> Recognizing his mistake, Ben starts to verbally backpedal.  “Hey man, chill...”
>
> Ben freezes, his eyes widening in fear.  Is he going to clobber me?
>
> Crushed by the rebuke, Ben’s face turns beet red and he flees from the room.

All of those are reasonable human responses to being intimidated.  An *inappropriate* response would be one in which Ben was not the least bit fazed by Andrew’s words:

> Ben laughs in Andrew’s face.  “I ain’t scared of you, old man!”
>
> Ben ignores Andrew, and turns back to Mary.  “Like I was saying...”

In rare situations, there may be extenuating circumstances where the player might respect the roll in an unorthodox way.  Players should discuss this first and try to make a reasonable compromise.  If you lose the roll, you have to offer some kind of concession.  Remember you can always contact staff if needed.

> &lt;OOC&gt; Ben's intimidated, but he's more scared of his gang than Andrew.  How about he makes a show of resisting and then Andrew can force him to sit.
>
> &lt;OOC&gt; Andrew says, "OK."

## Guardrails

There are some important guardrails in social combat to protect against harassment and obvious extremes.

* You may not use social combat to force another character into sexual situations without their player’s consent.
* You may not use social combat to force another character into an obviously-suicidal action without their player’s consent.
* Social combat is for short-term influence, like talking your way past a guard or convincing someone to do you a favor.  Longer-term goals require special handling, described under Gaining Influence, below.

## Double Jeopardy

Often social combat is a one-and-done situation.  You either bluff your way past the guard or you get caught.  But for more subtle manipulation, the attacker may want to try and try again. This is fine, providing:

* The attacker varies their approach each time. -or-
* A reasonable amount of time passes between attempts (generally you can try something once per scene).

In other words, Andrew can’t try to Intimidate Ben into sitting down by yelling at him, then immediately yell at him some more to try again.  Similarly, Ben can’t sit down for ten seconds and then immediately bounce back up and start mouthing off at Andrew again.

## Calculating Leverage

Leverage is calculated by considering several key areas: Obligation, Background, Consequences, Trust, and Influence - all described in detail below.  

Each area may contribute either a vulnerability ⚔ (in favor of the attacker), a resistance ◈ (in favor of the defender) or nothing (neutral) to the overall total.  

{% note %} 
An area cannot be counted more than once, even if multiple factors from that area might apply.
{% endnote %}

Once you’ve figured out what leverage applies, consult the following table to determine how to resolve the conflict.  Find the row corresponding to the number of resistances and the column corresponding to the number of vulnerabilities, and it will tell you what kind of contest applies.

Social contests are described in more detail below.

|  | No Vulnerabilities | ⚔ | ⚔⚔+ |
| No Resistances | Even contest. | Contest favoring attacker. | No contest - attacker wins. |
| ◈ | Contest favoring defender. | Contest favoring defender. | Even contest. |
| ◈◈ + |  No contest - defender wins. | No contest - defender wins. | Contest favoring defender. |

You may notice that this chart favors resistance over vulnerability.  That is because it is very difficult to persuade people to act against their own self-interests or against strongly-held beliefs.  Maintaining inertia is easier than driving action.

## Social Contests

Social contests are resolved using several opposed skill rolls. The basic roll is attacker’s Social Skill (e.g. Persuasion or Con or Leadership) vs. defender’s Resistance Skill (typically Composure).  The results of the individual rolls are weighted depending on whether the contest favors the attacker, defender or neither (as determined by the leverage chart above).

| Type of Contest | Rolls |
| ---- | 
| Even contest. | Make three rolls.  Best **2 out of 3** rolls wins the contest. |
| Contest favoring attacker. | Make three rolls.  The attacker only needs to win **one of the three** rolls to win the contest. | 
| Contest favoring defender. | Make three rolls.  The defender only needs to win one of the three rolls to win the contest. |

{% note %} 
If there is no clear winner (e.g. in an even contest where it was Attacker-win, Defender-win, Draw), then the tie goes to the defender.
{% endnote %}

## Gaining Leverage

Leverage is gained in several categories.

| Type of Leverage | Description | Examples |
| ---- |
| Obligation | Leveraging a sense of duty, oath of service, or other important obligation in the character’s life. | A knight’s sense of honor. <br/> A doctor’s oath to help the sick and do no harm. <br/>A parent’s devotion to their children. |
| Background | Leveraging a key component of the character’s personality or life experiences (typically as reflected in their background or RP hooks). | A soft spot for kids. <br/>A short fuse. <br/>A reputation for following the rules. |
| Consequences | Leveraging the impact on the character’s life if they do (or don’t do) the thing being asked.  This is a dual-sided coin of risk (which favors the defender) and benefit (which favors the attacker). | Risk to self or self-preservation.<br/>Career risk or advancement.<br/>Risk or benefit to family.<br/>Financial risk or benefit. |
| Trust | Leveraging a pre-existing personal relationship with the defender, a public reputation, or just facts and reason. | Friend or family relationship. <br/>Trusted authority figure.<br/>Hated enemy.<br/>A fishy-sounding story that doesn’t hold up to casual scrutiny.|
| Influence | This is a special category to reflect long-term impacts of repeated social contests.  See Gaining Influence, below. | n/a|

Remember, leverage can go both ways.  

* A doctor’s oath can work in the attacker’s favor if being asked to provide off-the-books care to a sick criminal, or it can work in the defender’s favor if being coerced to hurt someone.
* A bribe can work in the attacker’s favor if there isn’t likely to be any consequence, or in the defender’s favor if the risk outweighs the benefit.

## Gaining Influence

Just as the physical combat system is for individual battles, social combat is for short-term influence.  You can use it to con a guard or get someone to do you a favor, but a single social combat will not convince a zealot to renounce their cause or for someone to make sweeping lifestyle changes (like choosing a new career, becoming a double-agent, relocating to a new city, etc.)

For these longer-term goals, you need to break them down into smaller, intermediate steps.  Once you have successfully completed three social contests for intermediate steps, you automatically gain the Influence leverage over that person.  This makes future manipulation easier.
