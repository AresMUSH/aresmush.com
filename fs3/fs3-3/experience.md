Experience reflects the way a character grows and changes over time.  

{% fs3tip %}
The default FS3 configuration is geared toward a slower, more realistic progression than you might find in other RPGs.  You can pick up new skills at low-to-mid levels fairly quickly, but reaching the higher levels takes ages. Individual games may customize how fast experience is awarded, and/or how fast abilities can be improved.

## Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are gained periodically to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time.  You spend them to improve your abilities.  The number of XP needed to reach the next rating depends on the current rating, so higher skills take longer to learn.

You earn **1 XP** each week.  You may 'bank' up to 4 XP in case you forget to spend them right away.

## Spending XP

XP represents incremental learning or practice.  You spend XP as you get it, resulting in a gradual progression toward the next rating.  The cost to achieve a new rating is indicated in the tables below.  

{% fs3tip %}
XP should always be spent in a way that makes sense ICly, and should be supported by RP.  Your character shouldn't just wake up one day and be a basketweaving expert, or learn Swahilli with nobody teach it to him.
{% endfs3tip %}

When you spend XP on an ability, you have to wait **30 days** before you can spend XP on that same ability again. This effectively means that 1 XP = 1 month in the progression tables. You can still spend XP on other abilities while you're waiting.

Remember, games can customize this progression so consult your local game policies for specifics.

## Limits on Learning

Nobody can be awesome at everything. Characters may only advance so far beyond the character creation maximums, no matter how much XP they accumulate.

* You can only have up to 42 points in Action Skills total.
* You can only have up to 14 points in Attributes total.

The limits on skills/attributes at specific high levels (e.g., only a certain number of attributes at 4+) do not apply when spending XP.
