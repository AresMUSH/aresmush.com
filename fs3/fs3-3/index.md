# What is FS3?

FS3 (Faraday's Simple Skill System) is RPG system designed for MUSHes, currently in its **Third Edition**.  FS3 is:

* **Fast and Easy** - FS3 takes a simple approach to abilities and highlights skills that are relevant to gameplay.  The goal is to get players through Chargen and reviewed as quickly and easily as possible.

* **Roleplay-Friendly** - FS3 has a lightweight conflict resolution and combat system.  This frees you to focus on the story, not the dice.

Learn more about playing FS3 in the [FS3 Player's Guide](/fs3/fs3-3/basics.html).

## FS3 as a Framework

With just a few tweaks to fit the setting, FS3 can be used for anything from Wild West to Battlestar.  In this way, it is similar to generic RPG frameworks like D20 or FATE.

However, FS3 is *designed and optimized for* games that are:

* **Near-Modern** - Regular humans in a tech level not too unlike our own (no magic, super powers, augmentation, energy shields or death rays).
* **Cooperative** - Players who are on the same team (PvE).
* **Focused** - A narrow focus on what action mechanics can be detailed and/or automated through code.

Learn whether FS3 is right for your game in the [FS3 Design Guide](/fs3/fs3-3/choosing-fs3.html).

## FS3 as a Codebase

Since FS3 is designed for MUSHes, it is provided as a complete codebase.  FS3.3 is only available for AresMUSH.  Earlier versions were available for PennMUSH.
