Luck Points in FS3 are a way to give your character an edge from luck or fate.

## Ability Rolls

You can spend Luck Points in various ways to help your ability rolls.

* Before your own roll, spend a point to receive a +3 modifier.
* Immediately after your own roll, spend a point to get a re-roll and choose the better of the two rolls.

Only one Luck Point can apply to a given task, so you can’t give yourself a bonus and then also re-roll the result.

## Combat

You can spend a Luck Point for special effects.  See **[Combat](/fs3/fs3-3/combat.html#luck)**.

## Plot Points

You can also spend Luck Points to affect the outcome of plots. For example: you might spend a point to have the prosecutor lose key evidence in a trial, or to get a lucky break finding a missing witness. This is entirely at the storyteller’s discretion, and the number of points required will vary based on how much you’re pushing your luck.

## Getting Lucky

How you gain luck will vary from game to game.  See **[FS3 Core](/fs3/fs3-3/core.html)** for an example.
