Here's what's new and interesting in FS3 3rd Edition.  For older editions, see [Old Editions](/fs3/old-editions.html).

## Skill Changes

* Skill Ratings go from 0-8 instead of 1-12, with better descriptions of what the different levels represent.
* Changed the dice mechanic slightly, increasing successes.  
* Attributes can now be raised with XP.
* Background and Language skills now have a condensed, descriptive rating scale.
* Background skills are chaper - you get several for free.
* A XP system makes it easier to raise other skills while waiting for a big raise.
* Quirks are gone, replaced by RP Hooks.
* Defaulting works differently.  You no longer use the Attribute by itself, but roll the skill at the special new "Everyman" rating to reflect common knowledge.  This becomes Attribute+1.  With the target number change, this actually gives you a better chance of success than previously rolling 2x the attribute.

## Combat Changes

* Combat wounds have different names and effects.  Healing has been tweaked accordingly.
* NPCs no longer have specific ratings but general classes:  Goon, Henchman, Boss.
* Certain hit locations (like hand and neck) will no longer come up as random hitlocs but can still be targeted with called shots.
* Armor can now have different protection ratings in different areas, representing weak spots and mixed armor.
* Other minor mechanics tweaks.
