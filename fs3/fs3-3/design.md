With just a few tweaks to fit the setting, FS3 can be used for anything from Wild West to Battlestar.  In this way, it is similar to generic RPG frameworks like D20 or FATE.

FS3 works best for certain styles of games.  To find out whether FS3 is a good fit for your game, see [Choosing FS3](/fs3/fs3-3/choosing-fs3.html).

Learn about how to customize FS3 for your setting in [Customizing FS3](/fs3/fs3-3/tweaking-fs3.html).

The tendency for players to min-max in chargen is a common complaint about FS3.  For some specific strategies about how to minimize that, see [Managing Min-Maxing](/fs3/fs3-3/min-maxing.html).
