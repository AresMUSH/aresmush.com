## What is FS3?

FS3 (Faraday's Simple Skill System) is RPG system designed for MUSHes, currently in its **Third Edition**.  FS3 is:

* **Fast and Easy** - FS3 takes a simple approach to abilities and highlights skills that are relevant to gameplay.  The goal is to get players through Chargen and reviewed as quickly and easily as possible.

* **Roleplay-Friendly** - FS3 has a lightweight conflict resolution and combat system.  This frees you to focus on the story, not the dice.

## System Basics

### Abilities

Characters in FS3 have **Abilities** to describe what they know and what they can do.

There are several kinds of Abilities, summarized below.  For more details, see [Character Creation](/fs3/fs3-3/chargen.html) 

* **Attributes** represent basic abilities that everyone has to some extent.  Attributes boost related skills, and come into play when no skill directly applies.
* **Action Skills** represent training/knowledge in areas that are likely to come up in action/conflict situations during the game. 
* **Background Skills** are ancillary skills (such as hobbies and professions) that are important to your character, but not related to the central game action.
* **Languages** are the languages that your character can speak and/or read. 
* **Advantages** are an optional section that some games will use to represent things a character has that are not skills - resources, rank, connections, etc.

You can improve your character over time through [Experience](/fs3/fs3-3/experience.html).

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise, you can make an [Ability Roll](/fs3/fs3-3/conflict.html) with virtual dice to determine the result. 

[Luck Points](/fs3/fs3-3/luck.html) can augment your rolls or give you lucky plot breaks, at the storyteller's discretion.  

### Combat System

You can certainly resolve fights with regular ability rolls, but the [Combat System](/fs3/fs3-3/combat.html) has more detailed rules for managing physical combat.
