Characters in FS3 have **Abilities** to describe what they know and what they can do.  **Ability Ratings** are numbers that quantify the character's capabilities.  

There are several kinds of Abilities, summarized below.  For more details, see [Character Creation](/fs3/fs3-3/chargen.html) 

* **Attributes** represent basic abilities that everyone has to some extent.  Attributes boost related skills, and come into play when no skill directly applies.
* **Action Skills** represent training/knowledge in areas that are likely to come up in action/conflict situations during the game. 
* **Background Skills** are ancillary skills (such as hobbies and professions) that are important to your character, but not related to the central game action.
* **Languages** are the languages that your character can speak and/or read. 
* **Advantages** are an optional section that some games will use to represent things a character has that are not skills - resources, rank, connections, etc.

When conflicts arise, you can make an **Ability Roll** with virtual dice to determine the result.  Ability Rolls use a "count successes" system like nWoD or Shadowrun 4 where you roll a bunch of dice against a fixed target number and count how many of the dice are "successes".  For more details see [Conflict Resolution](/fs3/fs3-3/conflict.html).

FS3 also has a fully-featured [Combat System](/fs3/fs3-3/combat.html) for automating large combat scenes.

You can improve your character over time through [Experience](/fs3/fs3-3/experience.html).

[Luck](/fs3/fs3-3/luck.html) can help if you get into a sticky situation.
